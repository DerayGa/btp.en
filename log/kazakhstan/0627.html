Not even 5 o’clock in the morning, I had already gotten up, climbed out of my tent, </span></p><p>which had no insulation effect whatsoever. </p><p>I washed my face with the freezing water, and found my eyes bags were as big as walnuts, </p><p>thanks to those “sleepless” truck drivers.</p><p>I went into the restaurant and found that waitress had the same eyes bags like mine.  </p><p>Thanks for her kindness; she brought me a pot of hot milk tea, </p><p>which warmed me up from my heart to every single part of my body.  And she even refused to let me pay for it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I filled up my three water bottles before took off. It was really a great thing to travel in a country that tap water is drinkable. </p><p>I remembered when I biked in France, I might not pay attention to all the beautiful scenery in that country, </p><p>but the instinct of looking for drinking water never failed me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1070993_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I should get going now, 6:30 in the morning. </p><p>It was better to leave early, plus the weather was cooler, I hoped I can keep this good habit.</p><p> </p><p>It was downhill after leaving Koback (phonetic translation), </p><p>this long ride totally swept away my frustration from yesterday.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1070998_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was not complaining about the uphill biking experience, but the road condition in Kazakhstan was terrible, </p><p>so the experience here was really tiresome and frustrating.</p><p>Today was different. Not only I was biking downhill, and the road condition was great, and the air was fresh.  </p><p>Well, except the birds flying above my head like crazy, as if they were practicing some routines. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080003_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Talking about the birds, I have to tell you my first impression about this country.  </p><p>This was my third day in Kazakhstan; I was already very impressed about the terrible road condition, </p><p>and the dead animal bodies, such as porcupine, cat, dog but mostly birds, everywhere. </p><p>You can recognize some birds by the shape, but lots of them can be only identified by the feathers lying on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>In China, construction workers repairing the road were a usual sight when I biked, but there was none here. </p><p>This one was supposed to be one of the major highways, but if in China, this could only be at the best the country road.  </p><p>It seems like once the road built, no maintenance is necessary.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080014_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>My “happy hour” was gone as soon as I finished the downhill part of the road, </p><p>now I was climbing up, and the road condition was “down”.</p><p>Since there was still 160 km to Almaty, I didn’t want to force myself to finish that in one day, </p><p>which meant, I would just take it easy. I would like to have a good night sleep if I could find any nice place to spend the night.</p><p>I didn’t want to BUY any more maps at all, especially if I can find the big city without much problem. </p><p>The map would be labeled with names of the city, not the roads or the directions. </p><p>I was pretty confident that I could easily get my direction with that 10-tenge map and the Google Earth. </p><p>Well, unless the next part of the country I was going to ride has a better road/highway system, </p><p>then I might consider to get a new map. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080030_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were three donkeys waiting for the bus? I was laughing so badly that I almost fell down from my bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080021_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I couldn’t stop myself but buying 100 tenges of prunes.  </p><p>I didn’t want to buy too many, so I gave out my biggest coin, 100 tenges. </p><p>But from her face, it seemed like they usually sell that by bucket, she was calculating how many this 100 tenge could buy. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080035_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, let me help. I found a plastic bag from my pack, and handed to her. She thought about it and gave me lots of prunes.</p><p>Those prunes were neither sweet nor sour. </p><p>The lady showed me how to eat the stuff inside the pit, by cracking it with rocks. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080045_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Other than prunes, you can also buy drinks, but I was guessing this was not for me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080029_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Sometimes kids would run after me for fun. Most of the bikes in Kazakhstan have their wheels </p><p>decorated with colorful plastic stuff; this one was relatively “plain”so to speak.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080040_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was riding my bike and eating my prunes, and I thought I should still stop for this old time friendly place—gas station. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080046_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I didn’t want coke anymore, so I bought myself a liter of orange juice, to replenish my vitamin C. </p><p>I also got a chocolate bar and a pack of crackers.  </p><p>I was trying to understand the “money culture” from the great varieties of bills I got back from the casher.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080049_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080050_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I knew to cool down was not enough for me, what I really needed now was sleep. </p><p>I didn’t get much of sleep at all last night.</p><p>However, I finally adjusted myself back to an “early bird” mode; I didn’t want to spend my morning to SLEEP. </p><p>So, maybe, I should continue riding my bike until noon? </p><p> </p><p>I leaned a couple of new Kazakh words everyday, today were “one” and “bike”. </p><p>I also tried to correct the pronunciation of the words I learned earlier. </p><p>The language was only useful if other people can understand what I was saying. </p><p>I wanted to practice them enough that I could say them out any time I need to, without thinking it first, I mean.</p><p> </p><p>The dogs were not a rare sight in Kazakhstan; I was run after by 4 dogs today, luckily not the big or evil type. </p><p>I usually “barked” back at them to scare them away.</p><p>Sometimes I missed the days when I biked in China, which was “dogless”. </p><p>I was pretty nervous now whenever I heard any suspicious sound at my back. </p><p> </p><p>I finally found an abandoned gas station to take a nap around noon. </p><p>There was many sheep’s dung here, but no flies were attracted since there was no stinky smell.</p><p>I had such a good nap that I thought I could almost live here, as long as I get my good sleep.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080062_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Around 1 o’clock, I did some grocery shopping, and lunch too. </p><p>I saw a carton of “milk” in the refrigerator, and it turned out that was yogurt. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080064_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Thank god that I was not exactly expecting that was milk, otherwise, I would probably throw up after my first sip.</p><p>Oh, I also got myself an ice bar. Scanning through every aisle, </p><p>I really couldn’t find anything interesting for lunch, so I ended up getting an instant noodle and a pack of crackers. </p><p>Instant noodle was more or less the same everywhere I went, just another choice for lunch. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080068_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I passed several towns on the way to Almaty. </p><p>Some with signs but no sight, I guessed that was because lots of towns were not near the highway, </p><p>you needed to make turns to find it. As many towns passed by, all I could see were grocery stores, </p><p>coffee shops, or vegetable stands. But where was the hotel?  </p><p>I asked at lest three people before I believed that there was NO hotel at every town I stopped.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080098_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>“Be aware of running pedestrians!” Never saw this kind of sign before. </p><p>Kazakhs drive fast and crazy.  Most of the cares were antique cars, not many trucks.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080100_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>You usually could find “bike only” lane, but the road condition was just “terrible”. </p><p>Even though the bike only lane was mostly shaded, the horrible road condition still put me off most of the time. </p><p>I usually just bring my bike back to the regular highway.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080078_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>These were the produce. I thought Kazakh people don’t like to plant stuff, </p><p>and that is why so many lands were empty. But, see? You can actually find most what you need here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080090_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was almost like an outdoor supermarket, I wanted to buy everything, but I didn’t get anything. </p><p>I couldn’t believe they even sold inflatable water toys, I was wondering: </p><p>WHERE was the water that you could play those toys in?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080095_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Actually, I didn’t particularly care if I could find a hotel for the night or not. </p><p>What I really wanted was a place to wash my clothes. </p><p>I kind of started to disgust my own clothes at this point. I sweated everyday; I was wet from top to bottom. </p><p>Yes, don’t take me wrong.  Of course I had every intention to wear clean outfit, </p><p>but I couldn’t find any place to wash the dirty ones. </p><p>I did rub my body clean everyday before going to sleep, buy my </p><p>“clean” body soon then was covered by those filthy clothes that I wore over and over. </p><p>Sometimes I could even breathe my own stinky smell while biking.</p><p> </p><p>I needed hotel for its water to wash my clothes, and its space to dry my clothes after I washed them. </p><p>I would be thrilled if I could even take a nice shower and have a good nice sleep.  </p><p>As a matter of fact, I wouldn’t mind camping everyday as long as </p><p>I have unlimited supplies of fresh and clean clothes at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Some people have houses like this: with number marked on the tree trunk, </p><p>with a simple gate as the “entrance”, and the little path before entering the real house, </p><p>which was hidden in the deep end of the woods. </p><p>I saw many houses with similar arrangement, as if they were playing hide-and-seek.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080101_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, I was thirsty again, time to get a drink. I was a bit sick of juice now, </p><p>that was why I got milk instead at noon. </p><p>Uh… I wondered what was inside this big white bottle; I saw kids drank that earlier, </p><p>so I asked the cashier how was that thing taste like. </p><p>Well, of course he said, “great!” why did I even bother to ask?  I got one anyway.  </p><p>I heard a pop sound when I twisted the lid, which made me wonder if that was some kind of carbonated water. </p><p>Very carefully (don’t ask me why), I took the first sip. </p><p>I almost threw up right there… It was sour and strong, and the cashier dared to say that tastes great!  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080106_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>He looked me and suggested me to shake it before I drink it. </p><p>As far as I could understand, this thing was a fermentation product of milk,</p><p>after some who-knows-what process, it became a bubbling yogurt drink, </p><p>which was definitely not my cup of tea. I bet some game show can use this as a penalty drink for “losers”, </p><p>no modifications necessary.</p><p>Well, I didn’t want to drink it and I didn’t want to throw it away, either. </p><p>Luckily, there was a homeless(?) guy just outside of the door, </p><p>I gave him the whole bottle, saved me a lot of trouble. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080108_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally, around 6 in the evening, I saw a sign showing very familiar letter arrangement. </p><p>I flipped open my notebook, bingo. That sign said, “HOTEL”.</p><p>Thank god that I got some useful information about Kazakhstan in my forum before I entered this country.  </p><p>Otherwise, there was no way I could guess this spells “hotel” at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080112_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I asked for the rate, and I got a table. I could see the numbers and room number, </p><p>but what was the things on the first row? 1, 2, 3, more and more? Meant the number of people? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080111_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Anyway, of course I pointed to the cheapest one, and put out one finger (index finger) to say I was alone, 700 tenges.  </p><p>Not too bad, actually.</p><p> </p><p>Then… this was totally a misunderstanding. She thought I wanted to stay for one HOUR, not the one NIGHT. </p><p>The number indicated 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 1 night and 2 nights. </p><p>Therefore, I paid my 2500 tenges for a night, which was relatively expensive compared to that in China, </p><p>but kind of cheap if it is in Taiwan.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080114_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The first thing I did was to take a nice shower. </p><p>The bathroom in my room has only shower available (no toilet), which was exactly what I needed.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080116_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After cleaning myself from head to toe, I soaked my dirty clothes in hot water and laundry detergent, </p><p>and then air-dried them somewhere in the backyard.</p><p>I was determined to get my 2500 tenges worth. </p><p>I wanted to do the way the Fleck and Jacquin couple did, which was camping as much as possible in Kazakhstan.  </p><p>I would only go to hotel when I couldn’t stand my own stinky smell anymore, for example, today. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080118_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since the hotel rate is rather high here, this seemed to be the way to reduce the expensive.</p><p>There was only 30 kms away from Almaty, which I could imagine the expense could go only higher, </p><p>why not spent the night here, which is cheaper. </p><p>As to tomorrow, I would stay with a friend’s house IF I could find that address, </p><p>otherwise, I would keep moving to the west side of the city, to save money.</p><p> </p><p>There were not so many policemen around in this country. </p><p>Not that I needed their help, but it felt kind of weird since they were everywhere in China. </p><p>If anything happened in China, you just waited there patiently, eventually, some police will come by. </p><p>That was not the case here at all. The first police I saw was after I settled down at this hotel.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080122_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, their car was OK, kind of like a toy. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080134_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had my dinner at the restaurant.  As usual, I opened the menu, and asked them to order for me. </p><p>And the surprise dinner was “bread, milk tea and beef noodle”. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080119_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> This was similar to what I had at Amazhen’s house, </p><p>but it FELT better when served with some elegant utensils. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080131_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For the beef noodle, the waiter even brought me a pair of chopsticks, very nice.</p><p>People always told me that Kazakhstan has cheap meat, </p><p>but expensive vegetable before I entered this country. I always doubted that, until now. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080126_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>These bread and beef noodle couldn’t fill up my hungry stomach, so I ordered what other people ordered: mini-dumplings.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080130_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The size of these dumplings was about 1/3 of the regular size that you usually see in China. </p><p>They actually looked more like the dumplings/fishballs that we eat in hot pot in Taiwan, and they tasted really good.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080132_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This type of mini-dumplings was actually very common in any supermarket here. </p><p>Including 10 % of service charge, this dinner cost me 690 tenges, which is about 200 NTD, </p><p>which made me wish that I was still in China. Please send me back to China, the low expense heaven.</p><p><br /></p>
