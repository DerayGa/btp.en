										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-89_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Took off for one day, I was so fully “charged”, like the Chinese said, “I started the wind when I am on the move”. </span></p><p>Yes, that was how good I felt about myself today.</p><p>During those days in China, I got to take my time off every couple of days. </p><p>But in Kazakhstan, I finally could take one day off after biking for more than 20 days.</p><p>However, I didn’t bike as long distance everyday here as I did in China, </p><p>so I guessed I was not that tired- unless I couldn’t get a good night sleep. </p><p>I didn’t want to pay too much for breakfast, so I usually made a 700cc hot coffee using my own water bottle, </p><p>and drank that with 10 loaves of bread. Everything together was under 100 tengs.</p><p>Eating the breakfast and packing at the same time,</p><p>I thought I should be able to reach the border by today, and I wondered what that would look like.</p><p> </p><p>I was guessing, many trucks waiting in line? Probably not. </p><p>Because the border here opens 24 hours a day, the line can’t be too long. </p><p>I did hope, though, that I could find a little town there. A little town with restaurant, stores and hotels. </p><p>Because I would have to stay there for one more day until my visa became effective, </p><p>I would be really doomed if there was nothing nearby the border. </p><p>The worst scenario would be to camp around the border for two nights. </p><p>So, maybe, maybe the safe way was to stay here one more night, and then biked to the border tomorrow. </p><p>But, it was no use to think too much at this point. I decided to check it out myself.</p><p> </p><p>Different from yesterday, which was a rainy day, the sky today was clear and blue. </p><p>But my watch said the opposite, so I’d better just get on the road now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100471_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was not very straightforward to get to the border; I had to be extra careful to avoid getting lost.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100477_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The dark clouds started to gather around, and thunder was approaching, I guessed my watch was right.</p><p>I considered myself lucky since I could see a town that was not too far away. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100484_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I biked really fast and hoped I could keep myself dry this time. </p><p>Unfortunately, the rain started pouring and I was merely 500 meters away from a gas station. So I was still wet, half-wet.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100491_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally I was at the gas station; I saw it was raining and sunny at the same time. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100496_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I knew people said that the weather is unpredictable, but it was really too wild to me this time.</p><p>I got myself a carton of mango juice while waiting for the rain to stop. </p><p>I looked around and thought this town was probably a bigger one in Kazakhstan. It should be fun to pay a visit later.</p><p> </p><p>Stuff sold here was not good at all; I planned to get something yummy in that town.</p><p>People didn’t get into this gas station in time when the rain started pouring were all soaking wet.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100498_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Bread is pretty cheap in Kazakhstan. You need to pay BILLs for crackers or candy, </p><p>but for bread? A couple of coins can get you plenty.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100505_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I just paid less than 50 tengs for 5 of the palm-size bread, and I used the change to buy myself two ice creams. </p><p>One hundred tengs certainly can bring lots happiness.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100503_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though the rain had stopped, I was pretty convinced that it could come back anytime. </p><p>I needed to get on the move as soon as possible, so I was biking and eating my bread at the same time.</p><p>Just as I expected, the rain started again just as soon as I finished the bread. </p><p>The difference was, I had nowhere to hide this time. I put on my hat, and that was the only spot was not soaking wet during the rain.</p><p>According to MY observation, I just needed to bike fast for a little while-like 10 km while, I could be out of the raining “zone”.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100510_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This was the first time that I felt so confident about my own “weather forecast”.</p><p>I biked for a while and I really left the cloud behind.</p><p>Looking at the bright sky, I was feeling great, too. Even the road ahead was dry, which made me happy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100521_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sun came out eventually, it dried me inside out. I should thank god to do my laundry for free.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100543_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The border was not far away now; </p><p>I guessed I would be saying goodbye to Kazakhstan, as well as its crazy weather very soon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100525_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100540_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sign of Chelyabinsk city led me all the way to the border. </p><p>However, it is a city of Russia, not Kazakhstan.</p><p>This city had factories with red-and-white striped chimneys, which blow out the major air pollution.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100552_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I arrived at the border at around 3 o’clock in the afternoon. I did see cars, not trucks, waiting in line.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100554_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The Russia-Kazakhstan border allowed car to pass much easier, meaning the car could just DRIVE through the border. </p><p>This also made my life easier with Dido. </p><p>Not like when I was at the China-Kazakhstan border, </p><p>where I went through lot of trouble to take the shuttle bus from one place to another.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100556_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I hadn’t officially entered Russia, my cell phone already found the Russian wireless signal.</p><p> </p><p>There was no town at this side of the border, but the big city was clearly out there on the other side. </p><p>Other than two gas stations, there were a building for people work at the custom to live, a grocery store, </p><p>and a hotel, but these totally fulfilled my needs at this point.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100561_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I definitely didn’t’ need to camp for two days.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100567_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ignoring the cars waiting in line, </p><p>I went up to the custom to ask if I could enter Russia today (of course the answer was NO, I was just too bored).</p><p>Exactly as what I expected, the custom people looked at me, looked at my passport, </p><p>and pointed at the date, he asked me to wait until Jul 21.</p><p>As a matter of fact, I was pretty tired after biking in the rain. </p><p>I really would like to sleep in a comfortable bed for a change. So Dido and I decided to ask for the rate of that nice-looking hotel.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100557_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Probably because I had expected it would be really expensive, I didn’t feel too bad when they told me it was 2000 tends per night. </p><p>However, just like yesterday, there was no internet or entertainment in this hotel. All I could do was “relax”. </p><p> </p><p>I took a hot shower and walked to the restaurant at the gas station for dinner. </p><p>The car line to the border was still very long and moving slowly, but it WAS moving at least.</p><p>There were not many items on the menu at this restaurant, </p><p>so I ordered the meat-stuffed peppers with bread and milk tea. </p><p>It actually tasted pretty good, especially the meat stuffing was mixed with rice, made the whole thing tender and juicy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100571_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought two cartons of juice on the way back to the hotel. </p><p>I had way too much soda these days, kind of disgusting. </p><p>I didn’t have much vegetable after entering this country, but luckily I had loose bowel movement way too often in Kazakhstan. </p><p>I guessed that solved my potential constipation problem.</p><p>So, here was my solution of lacking vegetable, with more juice.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100576_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was going to take one day off tomorrow. I would try my luck 5 o’clock on the Sat morning, to see if I could enter Russia then. </p><p><br /></p>
