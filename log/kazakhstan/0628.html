										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-68_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><br /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Flies were everywhere in Kazakhstan, and they were getting on my nerves. </span></p><p>Even when I finally got myself a comfy bed, I had to win the patient contest with the flies before I can sleep in it.</p><p>During the day, the flies kept me company on my bike. </p><p>I couldn’t wave them away all the time because I did need to care for my own safety on the road.</p><p> </p><p>Wearing the clothes that I just washed yesterday, I was ready to have my breakfast and leave. </p><p>This was a rather simple meal, some bread and a pot of milk tea (maybe 6 cups?). I like my milk tea VERY sweet, by adding two</p><p>cubes of sugar for each cup. I liked to watch the cubes of sugar gradually dissolved into the tea, very entertaining.</p><p> </p><p>I should be able to arrive at the old capital city, which was less than 40 km away, around noon. </p><p>I was hoping that I could find this place that somebody gave me the information about. </p><p>Then I could spend the night there, and/or get online, or even some one will take me for dinner, </p><p>I also would like to buy a map, exchange the currency, etc. </p><p>IF I could fine this place, the place that I had only the street address with me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080138_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Many hitchhikers were trying their luck on the way to the city.</p><p>You could see so many different kinds of cars on the road, except the taxi. </p><p>That is because ANY car can be a taxi, a FREE taxi, as long as you can get it to stop for you.</p><p>These hitchhikers, men and women, old people and young kids, </p><p>they stood there with their right hand hanging down to the body and pointing their index finger out. Looked pretty subtle to me, </p><p>but very efficient for them, almost everybody got his ride this way.</p><p>Those people didn’t look like tourists, and they seemed to be very used to this type of transportation “system”. </p><p>No matter where they want to go, just find a spot, stand there with the “standard” hand gesture, </p><p>get on the car that you feel comfortable and you will be there in no time. </p><p>Sounds a bit unbelievable, but I think this is the best demo of carpool ever.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080143_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The more I was closer to the city, the more cars I saw on the street. </p><p>The number of the cars was way more than the number of pedestrians walking on the street. </p><p>I finally found a city with worse air pollution than Taipei does. </p><p>However, the title of the “Worst city for bike riding” still belongs to Almaty, no doubt.</p><p> </p><p>Although the road condition was much better closer to the city, </p><p>it was more dangerous to ride my Dido here due to the ridiculously large numbers of cars running on the road at the same time. </p><p>To make this experience even more exciting, these cars run so fast and pass you in a really close distance. </p><p>They didn’t bother to avoid you, and they didn’t bother to yield you. </p><p>I felt that my and Dido’s lives were purely on God’s hand here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080148_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I remembered when I was in China, I used the Chinese character “正” to mark how many ice pops that I had each day</p><p>(this character is exactly 5 strokes, so is easy to mark the number, </p><p>“count by 5”, that is. Similar to Western people use 4 vertical lines cross with one horizontal line). </p><p> </p><p>Here in Kazakhstan? I used the same character, but for different things. </p><p>Sometimes was the numbers of times that dogs chased me, sometimes was the number of dogs that chased me. </p><p>It was hard to count by dog, because sometimes they just all ran together after me at once. </p><p>Like today, I was chased by 6 dogs in total. My response was to first check what kind of dog/dogs was/were chasing me.</p><p>As long as they didn’t look scary enough to make me wet my pants, I would just let them be.</p><p> </p><p>The trees by the two sides of the streets were so close to each other </p><p>that I could not see what kind of crops were behind the street. All I could see here was tree, tree, and more trees. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080139_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080146_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, natural calls.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080150_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Around noon, I finally arrived in Almaty, the first big city of Kazakhstan for me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080157_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I expected to see skyscrapers one after another, but… I only saw regular size buildings, </p><p>no business district-like area, and only wide road/street.</p><p>I thought may be this was not IN the center of the city yet, maybe I will see very city-like area later?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080144_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the logo(official seal) of Almaty city. Almost every decent size city here has its own official seal. </p><p>Some use produce, Almaty is kind of unique by using a snow leopard on their official seal.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080169_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I actually rode around the entire city and my conclusion was, </p><p>maybe we should call Almaty a very big village instead of a “city”.</p><p>I exchanged about 12,000 Tenge at the border. And I finally got a sense of how much should/could I spend each day now. </p><p>So far my average expense was 1500 Tenge each day. </p><p>I only stayed at the hotel no more than twice a week, so that I could take shower and do the laundry. </p><p>I should have enough cash while I am in this country.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080180_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was just wondering how come there were so many cars. </p><p>Maybe the public transportation was not well-developed yet?</p><p>I rarely saw bus here, but I did see some train stations. </p><p>The train was running through the city on a rail that without any fence beside it, nice view, but kind of dangerous to me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080186_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080176_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I got a closer look, I found that both right-hand and left-hand driving vehicles were running </p><p>on the same road in harmony, which was really amazing to me.</p><p>When there was no traffic light available, a policeman would be sitting on their motorcycle to direct the traffic.</p><p>You’d better follow whatever he said, unless you want to get yelled at.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080188_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is really a “car city”, cars are just everywhere in this city.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080201_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Oh. I finally saw some construction workers. They are the reason that Almaty has such an excellent road condition.</p><p>I only hoped the road condition outside of the city was as good as this.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080185_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was kind of hungry when I was leaving Almaty at 2 o’clock in the afternoon. </p><p>I was not sure if this was a restaurant of a hardware store, until I saw the tables and chairs outside, I knew I found food.</p><p>I parked Dido and checked what other people ordered: noodle, fried hamburger with rice, salad,bread and milk tea. </p><p>Everything looked delicious to me; I just needed to figure out how to order some for myself.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080199_med_hr-4.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A guy eating his meal looked at me and “asked”- with his hand gesture, if I would like to eat something. </p><p>I replied with nodding my head like crazy.</p><p>Then a young guy with a white bandage on his face came to seat me and ordered some food for me. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080192_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I looked at other people’s food on the table and showed him what I would like to have. </p><p>So thanks to him, here was what I had: beef stew noodle, pork-stuffed pepper, meat-stuffed bread, and of course, milk tea.</p><p>I enjoyed every single one of them very much. This was just totally my kind of food and, importantly, my kind of price.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080194_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The milk tea was great, but I always saw sheep poop-like thing at the bottom of the cup. </p><p>It seems like the tea at Kazakhstan was processed in a special way.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080196_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>No matter where I go, people are always interested in my Dido. </p><p>The only difference of here and other places was, I could not understand what they were asking about anymore. </p><p>Therefore, I would “assume” their questions and answered them in my way.</p><p>For example, I always patted my chest and said “Taiwan”, meaning I am from Taiwan.</p><p>Well, maybe some of them have heard of Taiwan, but definitely don’t know much about it. </p><p>Otherwise they won’t ask if I rode my bike from Taiwan to Kazakhstan.</p><p>I guess not many people in Kazakhstan know Taiwan is an island. Just like not many people in Taiwan know where Kazakhstan is.</p><p> </p><p>I was getting more confused so far, about the question that Kazakhstan is a developed or developing country. </p><p>People selling fire logs on the street, unbelievable to me, but I could see their business was really good here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080164_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were only two cities that I planned to visit and stay in Kazakhstan: Almaty, the ex-capital and Astana, the current capital.</p><p>Almaty was my first destination, and I was finally here by asking for direction nonstop since I entered this country. </p><p>So next time when I asked for direction, it would be for Astana.</p><p>It seemed everybody knows how to get to Astana, which is ONLY 1100 km away from Almaty. </p><p>It should be fairly easy to arrive there.</p><p> </p><p>While focusing on keeping myself alive on the car-filled street, I was stopped by the traffic policemen, </p><p>I thought the bike was not allowed here, but it turned out that those policemen were just trying to shake hands with me. </p><p>Yes, very cute, I know.</p><p>I thought I should mention that I haven’t seen any road that bikes is not allowed in Kazakhstan so far.</p><p>There was a red plastic bag hanging out of my pack, </p><p>where I put tons of apricots that I didn’t know if I would ever be able to finish them. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080204_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I started get going as soon as I finished the lunch. It was very cloudy for the whole day, so it was very likely to rain any time, </p><p>I thought I should try to find a place, hopefully with roof of some sort since it </p><p>won’t be funny to get soaking wet while I was sleeping, to spend the night before it rained. </p><p> </p><p>I would be officially leaving Almaty once I passed this arch-like thing.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080206_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>They were selling some strange stuff, a huge tank marked “KBAC”, and I wondered that was water or oil.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080203_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had been circling the entire city and still couldn’t find the so called “Taiwan Trade Center”. </p><p>Maybe I should stop dreaming of helps from this particular place for tonight, I should accept the reality and counted on myself.</p><p>The rain started at around 4 o’clock. “Di-di-da-da” (this is how we describe the sound of raindrop in Chinese), </p><p>the raindrops just fell on my body; I knew the moment had come. </p><p>I had to keep going, though, nowhere I could stop at this area.</p><p>Finally I saw a “pretty” restaurant by the road, I brought Dido in immediately. </p><p>I stood under the eaves and stared at the rain that was getting heavier.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080208_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A waiter noticed me at some point so he peeked at me from inside. </p><p>Well, it was a bit embarrassing to just standing there, so I decided to order a pot of hot milk tea.</p><p>While waiting for the rain to stop, I was drinking my milk tea and making conversation with people work here.</p><p>This restaurant is pretty cool; everybody I can see here works here, except me, of course.</p><p>I plugged in the power and started to organize the photos and write the blog. </p><p>None of them have ever been to China, so I was so generously sharing my photos that I took at Urumqi, Sayram Lake, </p><p>Xian and so on, to fulfill their curiosity.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080212_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The one with glasses who was looking at me is the owner, </p><p>Falehodin(this is purely phonetic translation, since I have no idea how to spell that in English or Kazakh). </p><p>He looked at those photos taken in China and asked,”Are you sure these were not taken in Kazakhstan?”</p><p> </p><p>In addition to some middle-aged ladies and guys, you can see lots of younger people worked part time at this type of restaurant. </p><p>This is Modiho, Syvita, and Nemart (again, just phonetic). </p><p>Those two girls were students, only 18. The guy at the bar was only 23. Meaning,</p><p>I AM THE OLDEST ONE AGAIN. </p><p>However, nobody believed that I was actually 26; guess I still had a baby face (haaa).</p><p>Nemart made a coffee for me, and Modiho translated our conversation between English and Kazakh. </p><p>She also corrected my Kazakh pronunciation, and taught me some more words.</p><p>From right to left: Modiho, another-customer, Nemart, Syvita, the owner’s wife-Qualan, </p><p>the owner-who-was reading-my-blog, and two waitresses.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080214_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dido was “invited’ to come in and stay in another room, I was invited to stay for overnight and a warm dinner.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080216_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>With milk tea, bread, some side dishes, poached eggs, hams and candy, everything was just purely yummy.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting in the bar, I was drinking the coffee that Nemart made for me, and writing today’s blog. </p><p>What happened just minutes ago was now described in the blog in my laptop. </p><p>The real life suddenly became a story, just like in the book, “Neverending Story”,by Michael Ende, </p><p>a kid borrowed a book from the library and while reading it, he found himself was also in this book </p><p> </p><p>I guess I will be seeing a lot of kindness and help from Kazakhs while I am in Kazakhstan, </p><p>which was a stranger country to me at the beginning, </p><p>and yet I have already touched the warm and friendly side of this country even since I stepped into its border.</p><p> </p><p>They gave me hot drink when I was stopping for the rain; </p><p>they offered me a bed to sleep in as well as a free meal to fill my stomach.</p><p>Kazakh’s generosity and hospitality deeply touch me.</p><p>I love this country (even it has way too many cars running on the street), and I love the people here.</p><p> </p><p>I thank god to arrange this rain, so that I was able to meet these people, </p><p>who arranged my staying overnight inside of this warm and friendly restaurant,</p><p>instead of somewhere outside, where it was only cold and lonely.</p><p><br /></p>
