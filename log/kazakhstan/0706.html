Woops! </p><p>Perhaps it was too homey and relaxing, I forgot that I was in Kazakhstan.</p><p> </p><p>Breakfast was hot milk tea, hot coffee and bread – simple but tasty.</p><p>Sartana was busy getting a bunch of crackers on the table saying that granny wanted me to carry them on the road.</p><p>I had seen the same crackers in restaurants and also bought some in grocery stores myself. </p><p>They were not cheap. They gave me four bags with different flavors.</p><p>They did not charge me for breakfast and the crackers. </p><p>I quietly tucked a small 200 KZT bill in Sartana’s pocket as her allowance.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090177_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Right before I left, Sartana kept saying “labanmi” “labanmi” to me. </p><p>New word, never heard of it. She pointed her necklace and bracelet. </p><p>Did she mean to exchange souvenirs?</p><p>It reminded me of Kepa where I stayed one night a few days ago. </p><p>Right before I left the next morning, Guyweidian said “souvenir” in English and then gave me his resume.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at his resume where WORD, EXCEL were listed in the skill set section, so far, </p><p>I had not yet seen any other computer except mine in Kazakhstan. I was puzzled, but accepted it as a souvenir.</p><p>If so, I gave her the amber bracelet I bought in Urumqi.</p><p>However, I did not feel “labanmi” meant exchanging souvenir because when Sartana received the bracelet, </p><p>she ran back to the house and told granny that she said “labanmi” to me but I gave her a bracelet.</p><p> </p><p>It could be a good thing that we did not understand each other. </p><p>A misunderstanding might become some nice story.</p><p>Even though I did not understand Kazak, I did not focus on not being able to communicate. </p><p>When people talked to me, I attentively read their body language, eye contact and tone of voice. </p><p>Usually I could get the gist of it.</p><p>Don’t deny ourselves the communication ability.</p><p> </p><p>Sartana ran out of the house and put on a swoosh-brand black wristband on my right hand </p><p>where I used to wear the amber bracelet. She was wearing the amber bracelet on her left hand.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090182_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was not easy to take a picture of granny. It seemed that old people were shy in front of camera. </p><p>Sartana helped me to get granny for me to take a photo.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090183_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Waving goodbye, after riding less than a 100 meters, </p><p>I started wondering why the sun was so bright that it hurt my eyes. </p><p>Didn’t my sun hat do the job any more?</p><p>Then I found out that I forgot my hat, so I returned to granny’s in search of the hat. </p><p>Granny asked me what I was looking for.</p><p>I pointed to my head saying my hat seemed to be left here. As I touched my head, I realized that I was wearing my hat. </p><p>It was very embarrassed to be an idiot in the early morning, saying goodbye again. I was really heading off!</p><p> </p><p>I was riding toward the north; therefore the sun was on my right side in the morning and on my left side in the afternoon. </p><p>I had to wear my hat at a different angle with the sun; otherwise it wouldn’t block the sun at all.</p><p>However, having the hat tilted on my head, the wind blew it away from time to time. </p><p>I had to stop and go back to pick up the hat all day long. </p><p>Every time I stopped for my hat, I took a break and drank water. Picking up my hat became taking a break.</p><p> </p><p>It might sound stupid that looking for a “lost” hat on my head. </p><p>Something worse happened in the morning. </p><p>During packing up I could not find my orange raincoat anywhere, even though I went through everything.</p><p> </p><p>The last time I put it on was riding out of Urumqi in heavy rain, </p><p>and the last time I remembered seeing it was the large scale clean out I did at the border town Huoerguosi. </p><p>I was very sure that I saw it then.</p><p>How come it disappeared without a trace after a couple of days of riding?</p><p>I never realized its value until I lost it. When I had the raincoat, I was always too lazy to wear it in the rain.</p><p>From now on, even though I wanted to wear it in heavy rain I had nothing to put on. </p><p>Hopefully I could find a shelter when it rained and won’t have heavy rain during the rest of trip – another 100 days or so.</p><p> </p><p>I had fully recovered from the sound and restful sleep from noon to night and night to morning after a good meal at granny’s! </p><p>I had never felt better.</p><p>When hopping on my bike I felt like riding a good 150 km today toward the capital city and seeing if I could arrive a bit early.</p><p> </p><p>The same old scenery along the road day after day that one stretch of road up and down in the stark steppe, </p><p>which I had been used to after a while.</p><p>The landscape did not change much. However, the road surface was getting bad,</p><p>road workers would even paint the white line (road marking) with tar. Some of the tar started melting in the intense sun.</p><p> </p><p>The tar stuck to wheels easily. I had no choice but rode in the middle of the lane to avoid it, </p><p>and gave way to trucks when they came by.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090192_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The road workers must have been bored to death during their work, in addition to painting the road marking with tar, </p><p>they also used tar to draw on the road surface along the road, such as a naked woman</p><p>, a 卍 , strange slogans, funny animals and so on. It was like holding a kids’ art show.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090197_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Passing a few houses along the road, I still had a bottle of Fanta bought at granny’s </p><p>and full bottles of water so I did not stop for shopping.</p><p>A young camel man bravely stopped a container car. Wasn’t it impossible to hitchhike with a camel? </p><p>Or to sell the driver his camel?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090198_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>An interesting road sign which means:</p><p>“If you had a car break down in the middle of nowhere, or any emergency occurs and you need help, </p><p>you shouldn’t worry, an SOS phone can be found 70 km away”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090186_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Only one SOS phone was located in 70 km?</p><p>It would be more efficient and faster to replace the road sign with “God Bless You” or “Amitoufo”.</p><p>[Amitoufo is a Buddhist chanting]</p><p> </p><p>Near noon time, I opened up the peanut butter sandwich crackers, </p><p>drank up the soda for lunch, and then pushed on in full swing.</p><p>Around 1:00pm, a gas station with restaurant was in sight just as I started feeling a bit tired.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090199_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For my eyes, the photo was not just a picture that a camera captured, </p><p>but an intermediate way station for life which supplied me and allowed me to continue my journey.</p><p> </p><p>I bought two liters of peach ice tea at the restaurant, quaffing a bit, </p><p>and then suddenly feeling cold in the air-conditioned restaurant.</p><p>Changing from hot outside to cool inside and drinking a cold beverage heartily, my body could not adjust accordingly. </p><p>I walked outside to take a sunbath and feel the warm wind readjust my body temperature.</p><p>I took a long break in the restaurant mainly for recharging and writing up the travel log for the last two days. </p><p>My brain was back in business and able to tell stories sensibly.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090203_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had my lunch with the restaurant staff. I guessed they thought I was an Asian and did not speak Kazak at all, </p><p>so they brought in a plate of food mimicking eating food, and then asked me if I would like to eat?</p><p> </p><p>Really simple and easy body language. If I could bring a plate of food with me, </p><p>I would have no problem traveling around the world.</p><p>Lunch was curry-flavored stew potato with dough, onions, and carrots in it – very tasty. </p><p>Since it was quite salty to my taste I felt like accompanying the dish with rice.</p><p>However, I only got bread to go with it. Accompanied with hot milk tea and cold fruit tea, they made a great meal.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090205_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After filling up and writing, I was ready to go. </p><p>I bumped into a staff member from the body shop next door when coming out of the restaurant. </p><p>After he learned that I was from Taiwan traveling on a bike, he became very excited.</p><p>He asked me to hold a minute since he would fetch something for me. </p><p>I thought to myself “isn’t it time to exchange souvenirs again?” I did not have too much stuff left to exchange.</p><p>He came back real quick with a black long sleeve shirt and a piece of blue chalk </p><p>in his hand and wrote down his name “Misan” on the shirt.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090207_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then he passed me the chalk wanting me to write down my name. </p><p>I did “Deray” and “KZ” on the shirt, “KZ” meant Kazakhstan.</p><p>The shirt with our autographs was done. I thought Misan wanted to keep it as a souvenir. </p><p>It turned out that he wrapped the shirt on my shoulder and used the sleeves to make a knot in front of my chest.</p><p>The shirt was meant for me. </p><p>He wished that I could ride with it along the way and never forgot the friendship from Kazakh </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090209_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The staff of the restaurant gave me two bottles of 5 liter carbonated mineral water taken out from the fridge. </p><p>I would like to pay but they firmly declined my money.</p><p>I was fully loaded, and could take only one bottle of water. </p><p>Then they gave me a paper package which looked like expensive chocolate that I accepted delightfully.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090210_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Most of Kazakhs were very friendly, I was glad that 90% of them I had met were very nice. </p><p>Perhaps the only difficult person was suffering from a mental disorder, he did not want to behave like that.</p><p>At least I got my cell phone back, and nothing was lost. I should have left it behind and moved on.</p><p> </p><p>My bags were getting bigger with Kazakh friendship. </p><p>On the first day in Kazakhstan, I was picked up and taken home to overnight by good-hearted Kazakhs. </p><p>No matter where I camped, nobody drove me away.</p><p>I was able to find a safe place to stay every night and the locals also welcomed me to </p><p>overnight and gave me many gifts including a cap, an autographed shirt, crackers, chocolate and water.</p><p> </p><p>Even thought I did not know this country, </p><p>the longer I had been here the more I found out that arid </p><p>and barren landscape did not make the people cold and detached. </p><p>The long distance between towns and cities make closer bonding between people </p><p>which was totally opposite to the urban area where people were physically closer but mental far apart.</p><p> </p><p>The Central Asia/Kazakhstan might not be as flourishing as Europe, </p><p>or as marvelous as China, but they live their lives in their own way.</p><p>I as an outsider always criticized stuff like how old and rundown their houses were, </p><p>or how poor they looked, without understanding their culture that was indeed immature.</p><p> </p><p>Wrapping the black shirt bearing two names from two countries around me, </p><p>something seemed connected and linked by the knot in front of me.</p><p>Finally after being in Kazakhstan for more than ten days, I was able to get rid of my bias to appreciate their culture.</p><p> </p><p>After the restaurant, the thought was lingering on my mind. </p><p>I started to look back everything happened in Kazakhstan, </p><p>taking them from a different angle and starting to have a different point of view.</p><p> </p><p>In China, would a stranger who came to buy beverages be invited to overnight?</p><p>In Europe, would there be shops allowing strangers to camp under their overhang?</p><p>Are there any other people in the world who would be friendly and help others at any time with respect?</p><p>In Kazakhstan, that was what I experienced everyday. </p><p>However, I was always busy with getting rid of flies and overlooked the more important feelings.</p><p> </p><p>I had planned to ride a good 150 km today. However, my break in the restaurant was a bit long. </p><p>It was nearly 5:00pm when I left. The cattle were grazing in one line.</p><p>The reason for a long ride was to prove that I had fully recovered. </p><p>However, I was not pressed for time, what was the point of hurrying?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090214_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The road sign said the next city was more than 90 km away. </p><p>It would be overstretch to make it there. On top of it, the satellite map showed the road was leading up to mountains.</p><p>I returned and backtracked to the town where I saw a plain signboard for a restaurant hotel. </p><p>If it was cheap, I would stay there for tonight.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090215_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The price really surprised me. I had the staff key in the number on the calculator </p><p>to ensure that the price was not for one hour but for one night.</p><p>It was only 400 KZT, unbelievable cheap. The hotel located 30 km away from Almaty charged 2500 KZT for one night.</p><p>The cheapest hotel in the capital city Astana charged almost 10,000 KZT. Here, only 400 KZT?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090216_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>An impossible super-low price hotel was like finding treasure. </p><p>Unpacking the bags outside the door and bringing them in batches, I had a room accommodating four to myself. </p><p>The bed was a super soft spring bed.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090219_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The hotel looked shabby from outside, even its signboard was just a plain wood board painted with its name. </p><p>However, the facilities were amazingly luxurious!</p><p>The most wanted item, bathroom, had a super deep bath tub and a steam spa. </p><p>The bathroom was even larger than the hotel restaurant.</p><p>If they had the money to build such good facilities, why didn’t they make the signboard a bit more glamorous?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090222_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Happily taking a hot shower, disinfecting my dirty clothes in hot water,</p><p>I reflected that it was very important to keep my body clean for long term travel.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090224_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was a traveler, not a homeless person.</p><p> </p><p>I would have two more weeks in Kazakhstan where once I wanted to leave as quickly as possible. </p><p>From now on, with a new mind, my way and my view would be different. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090195_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><br /></p>
