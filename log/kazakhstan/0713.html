However I still had to start from here today.</p><p>I did not want to get on the temporary road, following the tire tracks in the dirt, and riding on the road still under construction.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100014_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The condition of the road under construction was much better than the temporary road. </p><p>However it did not last long, the road under construction was then too bad to ride on. </p><p>I had to go back to the temporary road and suffer.</p><p>The milestone, lying down by the side of the road due to the road construction, made me sigh.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100034_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After 12 km I rode into a larger city with the shops I needed. </p><p>My first stop was a grocery store for stocking up on snacks and water since I had run out of food.</p><p>Everything in the shop was labeled with pink price tags. </p><p>At the cashier, the total was shown on the cash register, no communication problem, and certainly no way to bargain.</p><p>I got a bottle of water and a big bag of chocolate cookies for 100 KZT which could supply me for the whole day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100021_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The signboards along the street were all low key and in letters, which made me see them but not understand them. </p><p>Spotting a signboard with a red cross on it, my instinct told me that it was a pharmacy.</p><p>If it was a pharmacy, I would look for eye drops. </p><p>Long time biking in wind and dust made my eyes sore and tired, so eye drops were consumed quickly.</p><p>Taking a closer look of the sign, it was not only a red cross, there was a snake coiling around a wine glass in the middle of it.</p><p>Very strange icon, couldn’t it be a bar?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100022_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was indeed a pharmacy when I went in to check it out, but no eye drops for sale, sigh!</p><p> </p><p>I found a place for lunch, two sunny-side up eggs, two sausages, a cup of milk tea and bread. </p><p>That was a perfect meal.</p><p>After filling up my stomach, stocking up on snacks and plenty of water, off I went in high spirits!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100024_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Right after I got out of the restaurant, the rain dampened my spirits again. It seemed heavier.</p><p>Outside the city, the main road was dug out terribly again. </p><p>I thought the road would lead me straight to the border, </p><p>but now I had to ask the vehicles passing by to ensure that I was on the right road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100030_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After a three hours of dumb riding I was getting wetter in the rain. </p><p>The air was very humid, so the wind could not dry my clothes. On the contrary, it made my clothes damp and cold. </p><p>Soon I was soaking wet. </p><p>The reason why I was still on the road was there was no shelter in sight along the road under construction.</p><p>I found no place for a break, but continued on in the rain. Finally a village was in view, </p><p>I immediately pulled into the town seeking shelter from the rain.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100041_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The dirt road leading to the village became slippery and muddy after the rain. I was about to fall.</p><p>It was too dangerous to ride. I walked Dido to the village. </p><p>There was a tall radar tower which could be seen from outside of the village and a few cement buildings, </p><p>all the others were wooden houses.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100044_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I planed to take shelter in the cement building, walking Dido over and opened up the blue iron gate. </p><p>The cement building was not small, but it did not have eaves or any place that I could hide from rain.</p><p>There was only an overhang above the entrance door, the width of Dido. I hurried Dido and myself to the entrance.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100048_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I was not exposed to the rain directly outside the building, </p><p>however, it was still really cold since the wind kept on blowing and throwing the rain at me.</p><p>Knocking on the iron double door, nobody responded, I thought the rain overpowered my knock. </p><p>After knocking harder, still nobody answered the door. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100050_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had been hiding here since 4:00pm, wishing somebody would come to work,</p><p>open the door and let me in to shelter from the rain. </p><p>Better yet, taking me in for one night – please don’t throw me out.</p><p>I thought I would get drier when sheltering from rain, but it had no effect on the result.</p><p>Even if I was in dry clothes, the moist air would also dampen my clothes while standing here.</p><p> </p><p>Squatting down by Dido in this tiny place, I looked down and saw a spider had started making its web on Dido’s wheel spoke. </p><p>The web scene really reflected the dreary atmosphere quite well.</p><p>There could be another spider out of my sight making a web on my body. </p><p>Who knows when the rain was going to stop? </p><p>After two hours of waiting, finally a man walked toward me in rain coat and rain boots.</p><p>Seeing me dispirited, squatting in front of the door, there was no need for me to explain what I was doing here. </p><p>Before saying anything, I was taken into the building sheltering me from the rain.</p><p>This man, Victor, was the building manager for this radar tower.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100052_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The first question Victor asked was “are you hungry?”</p><p>Bingo, I was suffering from hunger and cold. </p><p>Victor called his friend named Victor as well living in the village to bring over some food.</p><p>10 minutes later, a man in rain boots with an umbrella brought me something simple, </p><p>cold goat-innards stew, bread and raw eggs.</p><p>Except for the raw eggs that I did not know how to eat, I finished up the bread and stew without being picky about the food.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100064_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The cold food did not fuel me up, I felt like hot food. According to the current situation, it wouldn’t be easy to get hot food. </p><p> </p><p>Victor took out a large world map (Kazak version) pointing Hainandao, and asked “Is Taiwan here”</p><p>That was an exact question for me. Correcting Victor where Taiwan was on the map, </p><p>I used the map to show both Victors my bike route.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100070_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After filling up, I asked Victor if there were shops in the village.</p><p>Luckily, even though the small village had no restaurants, it still had a shop. </p><p>I followed the Victor who brought me food to the shop.</p><p>Walking on muddy road in my blue-white rubber sandals, I grew taller and taller because of the build-up of mud on the sole.</p><p>Later on I felt like I was walking on stilts and had to wash the mud off in a puddle.</p><p>I pitied myself before seeing three chickens walking in the rain like me and burst out laughing. </p><p>They literally looked like three drowned chickens.</p><p>[Note: “to look like a drowned rat” in Chinese is “to look like a drowned chicken”]</p><p> </p><p>I bought apple juice, soda pop, raisin cake and white chocolate in the shop, </p><p>and walked back to the radar tower myself in the rain to show Victor my booty.</p><p>We opened up the juice, eating the cake accompanied by the juice. </p><p>This place was not luxurious, but it could shelter me from the cold wind and the wet weather – I desired no more.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100065_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If I had fuel on hand, I would have ignited the camping gas stove and boiled some water to make hot brown sugar water.</p><p> </p><p>After we were full, Victor told me to spend the night here and not to ride in such weather.</p><p>I was thinking to take a break, and when the rain stopped or started to slacken a bit, I would hit the road. </p><p>However, after being invited to stay overnight, I opened up all my damp bags for ventilation. </p><p>Without doing so, they would be messed up.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1100068_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I camped inside the factory building by night, hoping it would be a nice and clear day the next day when I woke up, </p><p>and would never ever complain again about fierce sun or hot weather – I really meant it.</p><p><br /></p>
