										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-75_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I woke up at dawn. I didn’t sleep well. </span></p><p>I spent the entire night closing my eyes and volunteering my blood to the mosquito inside my personal tent.</p><p> </p><p>For the record, I had more than 40 mosquito bites all over my body. </p><p>I was applying the mentholatum (we used a lot in Taiwan for little bit of everything) </p><p>and found myself basically rubbing that all over my two arms.</p><p> </p><p>The experience I encountered yesterday slowed down my brain function, so it took me a while to reset my priority. </p><p>Bu the sudden tummy ache reminded me that I also had diarrhea and vomiting symptom too.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090126_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Therefore, the first thing now was to find a restroom. </p><p> </p><p>I was lucky enough to know that god has not abandoned me yet.  </p><p>He gave me a gas station and a quiet space to clean up my body.</p><p>My body ached, and tired, and I still had to repack everything. </p><p>I had no energy nor mood to check if anything, other than my cell phone, was missing.</p><p> </p><p>I had vomited pretty much everything yesterday, and I couldn’t make myself to eat anything now. </p><p>The only thing I could take at this moment, even from a five-star restaurant would be, water. </p><p> </p><p>Before I left this city, the only thing I knew I had to do was to get my cell phone back, </p><p>no matter it was functional or not, no matter it was in good shape or only debris was left. </p><p>I had got to get my cell phone back, no matter what it took.  </p><p>I only hope that Ahloze was “normal” after a good night sleep, otherwise I might have to fight with him to get my phone back.</p><p> </p><p>The restaurant was closed at this hour, just as I expected. </p><p>I told the cleaning lady that I came to pick up my cell phone. </p><p>But she asked me to come back later when others came in to work.</p><p> </p><p>Without much luck, I went to buy myself a bottle of water, </p><p>and I found my body finally accepted the water without kicking it out right at the moment I gulped it down in my throat.</p><p> </p><p>I got my sense of humor back, I guess. Because I found it funny that even at this early hour, </p><p>the store couldn’t give me 30 tengs back when I handed him a 100 tengs bill.  </p><p>I was wondering he was going to deal with this situation, and the answer was:</p><p>I got some chewing gums and a box of matches. </p><p> </p><p>It was still early, so I went around the city to see if I could find any internet.  The answer was of course, N-O.</p><p> </p><p>Back to the restaurant around 8 o’clock and it was still closed. </p><p>I knocked the door and saw the same lady that I met earlier. </p><p>I insisted to get my cell phone right then, so unwillingly, </p><p>she brought me to the back and showed me the phone in the restaurant.  </p><p>I said I needed my own cell phone, which Aloze took it from me last night. </p><p> </p><p>She probably couldn’t figure much of what I was saying, but she did recognize the name, Aloze. </p><p>So she showed me his room and I found that he was still asleep. </p><p>I asked the lady,” Do you happen to know he is a crazy nut?”  </p><p>I looked around everywhere between the restaurant and the backyard.  </p><p>Finally, I found my cell phone outside of the restaurant, it was scratched, badly, but at least functional.</p><p> </p><p>I couldn’t wait to leave this city. </p><p>Who cared if I didn’t get the chance to take a swim here or not? </p><p> </p><p>At the border of Barhashi, a waiter waved to invite me for breakfast, and I was hesitated. </p><p>Yesterday’s experience broke my instinct to trust any human beings, for a while, I guess. </p><p>However, I repeatedly told myself that I should not ruin my journey in Kazakhstan just because of a nut.</p><p>I was impressed of how friendly Kazaks are. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090132_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I didn’t want to change that for that nut, either. So, I stopped and took a look at that restaurant. </p><p>I told myself that nice people get up early, and I walked over with courage.</p><p>The owner and his wife were really nice people. I told them that I could only have some milk tea because of my stomach. </p><p>The lady still brought me some sliced tomato, cucumber and three eggs.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090129_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The Kazaks are still nice people; yesterday was purely a bad luck day for me.</p><p>This “unlucky” experience also reminded me to behave myself during the trip. </p><p>Think about it, I always told people that I was from Taiwan, </p><p>which sort of made me an unofficial “Taiwan ambassador” to the locals here. </p><p>They would also make their judgment about Taiwan people from my behavior. </p><p> </p><p>I am sure if I did something to irritate people I met here, not only they would loathe, </p><p>they probably would think “All people from Taiwan are the same”, in a bad way.</p><p> </p><p>The breakfast was great, and the people in the restaurant were even nicer. </p><p>We talked about my trip and they offered me a couple of tips for my bike from here to Almaty, </p><p>which I found out all the information they gave me was not exactly “right”.  </p><p>They told me that I would have a great biking experience from here to their capital. </p><p>The road condition would be fine and there would be many stores and restaurants. </p><p>I was so relived, until I was on my way again.  All I could see was just deserted lands here and there.</p><p> </p><p>The owner gave me a brand new white cap, which he said I needed that for the sun. </p><p>I pointed to my head to show that I had already had one, </p><p>but he insisted that it was a gift from a Kazak and it represented the friendship.</p><p> </p><p>After filling up my stomach, I felt so much better—physically and mentally. </p><p>Well, since I had decided to continue biking for today, I knew I had to replenish my energy source—food. </p><p> I pointed to my empty plate and took out my money. The lady told me was 100 tengs, which was dirt cheap. </p><p>To express my appreciation, I gave her 200 and asked her to keep the change (by waving my hand). </p><p>I was not rich, but I was very grateful for their kindness when I needed the most. </p><p>They also let me fill up my water bottles: one with water, one with hot sweetened black tea.</p><p> </p><p>Before I left, I noticed that the wind was not blowing to the usually direction. </p><p>I pointed at the chimney and coughing at the same time to say the effect of that air-pollution. </p><p>They all agreed with me by badmouthing those chimneys.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090134_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Honestly speaking, I was pretty tired of the scenery in Kazakhstan. </p><p>It seemed like everywhere is the same: boring.</p><p>All I could do on the road was listening to the exhausting pipe and guessing how many tires the car behind me had, </p><p>was that a sedan or a truck, or would that car yield to me or just pass me by.</p><p>Sometimes if it didn’t feel right, I would yield to whatever car behind me. </p><p>After all, there were already too many dead animals on the road, there was no need to volunteer one more.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at those dark clouds, feeling the wind blowing from one side to the other, and drizzling was just the beginning. </p><p>I thought maybe this light rain could keep me awake, which was not a terrible idea. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090136_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were water puddles everywhere from the raining yesterday, </p><p>and those trucks ran fast enough to splash the dirty water all over my Dido and me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090139_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The rain was on and off, and I could see the real evil—the dark cloud that occupied the entire sky, was still waiting for me.</p><p>The deafening thunder marked the entering of the evil’s territory, </p><p>and the strong wind tried its best to push me to the other side of the road. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090142_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The rain was loud and heavy, sometimes I wondered it was raindrops or hails that were falling from the sky. </p><p>Anyway, I chose to stop for a while by the drainage pipe area.</p><p>A couple of times, I thought of camping in places like this. </p><p>However, when I took a closer look, it was full of dung, which totally put off this “dream” of mine. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090151_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The wind blew sideways, and that is why hiding here worked. See! A frog just jumped out of nowhere after the rain.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, the rain kind of stopped. Or you could say the “evil” was blown away by the wind, </p><p>therefore, the rain had to move with it.</p><p>Wiped away the water on Dido, I continued to bike. </p><p>The air was so fresh after the rain, the temperature was also cooling down to a comfortable level. </p><p>I closed my eye to breathe the clean air, AND… my face was wet by the truck just passed by.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090153_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I only saw one building so far, and I couldn’t figure out what kind of store/restaurant it was. </p><p>I went closer and found that was empty and deserted.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090141_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Around 3 o’clock, finally a real restaurant appeared. </p><p>Of course I had no idea what the sign said, so I went in and asked the daughter of the owner. </p><p>She told me that was her brothers’ names. </p><p>She has two brothers and both of them worked in another city,</p><p>so she and the grandma took care of the store now (so it was a restaurant and a store after all).</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090154_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The grandma came out and asked me what she could do for me.</p><p>I gestured that I needed something to drink, and she gave me a big bottle of Coke. </p><p>Well, I was feeling better, some coke should be OK.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090156_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I sat outside drinking my coke, and the grandma asked me where I was during the heavy rain. </p><p>I replied by squatting down and covering my head with my arms, and the grandma was laughing out loud. </p><p>She pointed the wooden platform area and asked if I would like to take a nap there.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, I didn’t have any motivation to ride any longer for today, </p><p>what I really would like to do was to spend the night here</p><p>The rain filled up the gutter and the wooden platform area was a bit wet. </p><p>The grandma put a big rug down, and I took out my sleeping bag. Time for a nap, how nice! </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090157_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I slept from 3 to 8 pm, and I walked somewhere outside to pee. </p><p>The sunset made my shadow look really long, especially the legs.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090161_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There was a power pole outside of the house, </p><p>and all I could think of now was, how to “borrow” the electricity for my laptop. </p><p>However, it looked like a rather complicated apparatus.</p><p>I shall wait until 9 o’clock, which was the time the electricity was delivered to every household.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090163_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>They had two dogs, both are BIG dogs. They were chained outside because they barked to people.  </p><p>I told them that they should learn their lesson while being timed out here.</p><p><br />On the other hand, a cute little kitten was running freely in and out of the house.</p><p>I cleaned up my face, cleared up my mind, and started talking to those two ladies.</p><p>The daughter’s name was Shartena, 14. This is their restaurant, store and also their house. </p><p>This place is called “Backdownada”(just a phonetic translation, couldn’t find the name), </p><p>and their house is the only human house in this town.</p><p> </p><p>The grandma’s name is “Numina”. I bet she didn’t expect me to take a 5-hour nap when she asked me this afternoon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090159_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>She offered me food, and I thought hot milk tea was my safest bet.  </p><p>However, as kind and considerate as the grandma was, she brought me rice and burger, </p><p>with some juicy sauce on top of it, the whole meal was tender and delicious. </p><p>I finished the whole plate, which meant I was recovering even faster than I expected.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090172_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The old grandma asked if I really wanted to continue to bike, or if I would like to spend the night. </p><p>I was a bit embarrassed but glad that I was able to camp outside of this house. </p><p>The kitten was busy inspecting my tent and the packs while I was setting up the tent.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090165_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally, 9 o’clock came, which meant, electricity came. </p><p>The light brought quite a few customers, so the daughter and the grandma were very busy taking care of the business. </p><p>I, in the meant time, was trying my best to charge whatever needed to be charged. </p><p>The grandma was worried the safety of my packs.  </p><p>Since there would be even more customers-- such as truck drivers, come in later, </p><p>she suggested me to bring my packs inside of the house to be safe.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090176_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I just realized that my everyday in Kazakhstan was a camping day, </p><p>which was a challenge to me, both mentally and physically. </p><p>I thought camping was fun at the beginning.  After a while, I thought camping was tiresome and “dirty” (no shower possible). </p><p> </p><p>As for now, I was kind of getting used to it. Give me a roof, give me some light, and I was happy.</p><p>The trip in Kazakhstan was not as easy as that in China, and this was my 10th day here. </p><p>I should really try my best to get used to it. Maybe the trip in Russia would be even worse.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1090174_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For what happened yesterday, I didn’t do my blog last night, </p><p>because I didn’t want to give out the words like </p><p>“ Kazakhstan is a place for people who like to see flies everywhere”, </p><p>or</p><p>“ Kazakhstan is a boring place and all you could see is deserted space here and there”.</p><p> </p><p>I would prefer to review yesterday when I had some time later. </p><p>Plus, there was no internet available here anyway, why not sleep more tonight, so I could get well soon.</p><p> </p><p>The grandma asked how my schedule was like tomorrow;I told her that I would leave around seven. </p><p>She explained that if they were not up yet by the time I was leaving, I should just knock the door to get my packs.</p><p>After saying goodnight, I went to my tent to get ready for a good night sleep. I really like sleeping in the tent.</p><p> </p><p>It was very quite when I got up to pee in the middle of the night. </p><p>The electricity was gone, so was the noise, including the dogs that barked wildly during the day.</p><p>Shivering a bit, I ran back to my warm sleeping bag. I still got a couple of hours to sleep before it’s dawn again.</p><p><br /></p>
