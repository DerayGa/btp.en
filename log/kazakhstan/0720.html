										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-90_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">The weather was changeable, dry to wet, and wet to dry, and switched rapidly. </span></p><p>It was sunny at one moment, but poured the next minute.</p><p>I stayed in my hotel room, watching Takeshi Kitano movies the whole day. Good movies enriched my rest days.</p><p>Today, I watched ‘Kikujiro’s Summer’ about a boy living with his grandmother looked for his mother during summer vacation.</p><p>Less than one hour after setting out, he is extorted for money by bad kids. </p><p>It turns out that he is accompanied by an irresponsible man (who is worse than the bad kids) to look for his mom. </p><p>Many things happen along the way. The story is quite long and not simply about looking for mom. </p><p>The movie has Kitano’s unique style, super funny but very touching.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/vlcsnap-1008972_med_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In addition, I watched ‘Dolls’ which is one of only a few movies directed by Takeshi Kitano without himself playing in the movie.</p><p>Three love stories are woven together in the movie. </p><p>The red rope fate story connects the entire movie, and the other two stories were just side stories.</p><p>Two lovers are tied together with a red rope. When the boy breaks up with the girl, she loses her mind. </p><p>The boy can not let go of her, and goes back to her by giving up his future. </p><p>The two of them go on a journey through four seasons.</p><p>A very affecting movie with soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, </p><p>costume by Yohji Yamamoto and superb background scenery make it hard to believe that the movie is directed by Takeshi Kitano.</p><p>It is because that Takeshi Kitano is famous for his balletic brutality. </p><p>After many gangland fighting and killing movies, ‘Doll’ might change your impression of him.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/vlcsnap-1005125_med_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>‘BROTHER’ is his typical stylized violence movie about a yakuza head sets up a drug empire in USA.</p><p>Even though the movie is long, you won’t feel it because it is so splendid. </p><p>I had seen it a couple of times, however the plot and the performance attract me every single time.</p><p> </p><p>‘Zatoichi’ is about the story of a blind swordsman in ancient Japan. </p><p>I thought Japanese costume dramas were all boring, but ‘Zatoichi” breaks my stereotype impression.</p><p>The goofy humor blow your mind. </p><p>Kitano has his best performance in this movie since Kitano is always in a playful mood in the rest of his movies, </p><p>but did this one seriously.</p><p> </p><p>There are many others, such as ‘HANA-BI’ (aka ‘Fireworks’), ‘</p><p>Violent Cop’, ‘3-4 jugatsu’ (aka ‘Boiling Point’), ‘Kids Return’ and ‘Getting Any’.</p><p>After so many movies in one day, I noticed that same faces repeatedly appear in his movies.</p><p>If favorite actors/actresses die in one film, they will reappear in another film playing different roles, which is quite amusing.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to watching movies, I ate in the gas station’s restaurant when I was hungry. </p><p>Even though I could not read the menu, I still understood numbers and was able to tell the difference between expensive and cheap.</p><p>The expensive hotel’s restaurant made me feel like screaming “help”. </p><p>The hotel room was not cheap, so I skimped on food walking 300 meters to dine at a gas station. </p><p>I was indulging in movies, so I only ate once today.</p><p> </p><p>In addition watching movies casually, I studied a few Russian words since I would be crossing the border into Russia.</p><p>Russian was hard. I almost tied up my tongue but barely pronounced one phrase “Thank You”. </p><p>I would do the rest when getting into Russia. </p><p> </p><p>The next movie on screen was ‘A Scene at the Sea’ still directed by Takeshi Kitano.</p><p>Hush! Keep Quiet</p><p><br /></p>
