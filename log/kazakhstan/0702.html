The restaurant is opened for breakfast also.</p><p>        I walked to kitchen directly to see what kind of food I liked that was faster and convenience comparing looked at menu. </p><p>There was sound coming from a pan; the chef was frying meat in a pan; the air was filled with delicacies smell.</p><p>        I pointed to the pan; I wanted to have this, gave it to me, gave it to me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080741_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>        The owner also cooked 2 eggs and took a big bottle of apple juice from the refrigerator. </p><p>I hadn’t this type of food, including breads, for a long time.</p><p>        Besides ate my owner food, I also looked others food from tables around me.</p><p>        The noodle soup looks like delicious from the table next to me; I ordered the same soup. </p><p>There are potato, noodle, and chicken meat in the soup; the soup is delicate.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080744_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>        I had a full and delectable breakfast. 2 litter of juice could not be finished before I started to bike; </p><p>I put left juice on the water bottle holder for later to drink.</p><p> </p><p>        It was time to go; no matter this was a homely hotel. There is still a long way to go, </p><p>although I didn’t know where my next destination today is.</p><p>        It is a burning day; today is almost like yesterday. Unfortunately,</p><p>wind was blowing this morning and against the wind; it was a hardy morning.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080755_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The only different is the scenery; there is a lake on the right side of the road. </p><p>Even I was riding along the lake, but the road is not built beside the lake; I could not always see the lake.</p><p>        Sometimes the lake is so closed and sometimes not. When it is far away, I even didn’t know where the lake is. </p><p>If the temperature is too hot, I want to cool down my body by riding into lake.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080751_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The water plants are flourishing around the lakeside, just like wetlands. </p><p>There are many different bird sounds; it is amazingly there are many different types of insects.</p><p>        The feces were not normal for past few days. Every time I had collywobbles; </p><p>I needed to find a hidden place to take care of it. Probably all foods, I had eaten, were already been eaten by flies; </p><p>also the wafer I had drank is strange. My digestion system was still not acclimatized.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080752_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are more houses on the road when closer to the Capital; they are a single house on the wold. </p><p>There is a restaurant, gas station, or hotel around every 10 kilometers.</p><p>        I could take a brake or buy some food when I needed it. </p><p>Since there are more stores available, it provides me the calmness of emotion for the rest of the day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080798_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is a super mini-hotel; it is pity and still early for me to stop today’s journey.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080793_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There must be a lot of fishes in the lake; many fish street venders sell smoke fishes on the road. </p><p>The vendors use a simple table and a shingle to start their business.</p><p> </p><p>The smoke fishes are big, and the fishy smell is very heavy. </p><p>I don’t know who to eat them even if I buy them, but cats must love the fishes very much. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080770_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080773_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Kazakhstan polices always ask me to stop, but just for talks. After some talks, then let me continue my trip.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080781_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Today I had passed through a bigger town; there is a train station. It looks like a prosperous town.</p><p> </p><p>But they are all the same - the small single house; there are many power poles, junk cars, used tires. </p>
											<p>The buildings are disappeared.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080782_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Before I started the journey this morning, the restaurant owner gave me some bread as snack. </p><p>The bread with juice was my lunch at the shadow area of the bus stop.</p><p>The clothes I washed yesterday were still not dry yet; </p><p>it was a good time to dry them in the sun during the lunch time. </p><p>Within intense heat and blowing wind, the clothes were dried quickly. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080778_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As long as drivers saw me in the bus stop, they always stopped and to check if I needed a free ride.</p><p>        Even don’t need to thumb a ride on the road side; cars always stop to provide a free ride. </p><p>Here is a good place for hitchhike.</p><p> </p><p>I started to bike right away after the lunch. A while later a car with 3 people asked me to stop the bike.</p><p>        They originally just wanted to have a short talk with me. </p><p>After the short talk and drove away already, they changed their mind and stopped the car again. </p><p>They waited for me and liked to have a long talk.</p><p> </p><p>While people are grin from ear to ear, you can see there are many golden teeth; </p><p>this country must have a good welfare program for dental. </p><p>Government will pay all false tooth cost when people needed and only make golden tooth.</p><p>        Took out my camera for pictures; when they saw the camera, they were so excited and brought a gun out from the car.</p><p> </p><p>        Is it legally to own a gun in Kazakhstan?</p><p>        I was taking pictures with hand shaking; would like adding the note below at the bottom of the picture.</p><p>        We have the Dido. If you want it back safely, please bring one million US dollar to get it back.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080748_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>        Although the people live in worn-out houses, the cemetery is better and beauty. </p><p>Seeing a gravestone and grave area from time to time, they are magnificent and dignified.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080765_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I could see many people were driving cars and playing water at the lakeside when I was close to the lake.</p><p>I only dipped my feet in water when I saw there was clear and cool lake or river. </p><p>This time I want to find a good place and swim in there; yes, this is my tomorrow’s plan.</p><p> </p><p>Again, there is another lake without any water. </p><p>If there is water in this lake, this road would pass through the lake, and the view must be very beautiful and scenic.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080807_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080812_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sea level for this highway is not high, but it is in mountain and up/down sloping road. </p><p>The sea level for the road is between 200 to 300 meters; </p><p>not like in China, the same highway can have 2000 kilometer sea level variance.</p><p> </p><p>        Had a break at a gas station; there is a convenient store in the station. </p><p>The owner is smiling happily; will see many golden teeth again in mouth if paying a little of attention.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080786_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Bought some back up food here; for easy carrying and high calorie, I bought 5 pieces of peanut chocolate bar. </p><p>Had the chocolate bars in freezer first, although they will be melted on the road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080788_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Flies are over everywhere, including in gas station. </p><p>It was impossible for lunch nap here; how can Kazakh stand so many fries?</p><p>        Kazakh are unbelievable. Even flies are on their body; they don’t feel flies, just like flies are not existed. </p><p>I am the only one dispersing flies.</p><p> </p><p>        Besides flying noise from the flies, biting flies make me mad extremely. </p><p>If I am a scientist, I must to invent a medicament that can eliminate flies.</p><p>Since I could not have the nap, continue bicycling toward today’s destination. </p><p>No matter where my destination is today, there are least 100 kilometers to go; it is long. </p><p>I felt exhausted. Keep bicycling until I am truly tired. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080792_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>        There were a lot of clouds today; I had more easy biking time under the shadow. </p><p>From the picture, you can see it is a nice weather day.</p><p> </p><p>        Clouds were all over the sky until the horizontal; it looks like fake scenery.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080817_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Around 6PM bought a bottle of coke in a small shop. There is a dog; it didn’t not bark at and chase me, and is well-behaved.</p><p> </p><p>        Even though food in the bag was no much left, still gave the dog a hot dog.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080834_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080833_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While looked at the dog eating the food I gave, I also started to feel hungry. </p><p>The shop owner also has a restaurant; it is time for dinner.</p><p> </p><p>There is a case of eggs and some crackers on tables; didn’t know these are for sale or just like seasoning as free.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080836_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Today’s chef’s special was deep fry meat cake which is mixture of ground meat and onion. </p><p>In order to have a full dinner, it needs bread also, but this only cost me $200.</p><p> </p><p>The milk tea after the dinner comes with meal. </p><p>As long as I could stand for flies, it is a good place for organizing the trip log. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080843_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The chef is daughter in law (left) in this family. Her name is Natasa and has a child; her husband is in Uzbekistan.</p><p> </p><p>        Young brother, Falahata (center), 13 years old, he has both bloods of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. </p><p>He was always around me and asking me a lot of questions.</p><p> </p><p>Mark (right), 15 years old, looks like not belonging to this family, but living with this family. </p><p>He is Russian; no one will restrict him. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080848_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Walked around after the meal at the outside of the restaurant, I was looking for a good location for camping tonight. </p><p>The flat area under the bridge looks good, although there is much garbage.</p><p> </p><p>        Falahata asked where I would sleep tonight; I pointed the flat area under the bridge.</p><p> </p><p>He brought me to their home and showed me the room where they sleep, </p><p>told me I could sleep here and didn’t need to sleep outside. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080847_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I put Dido at the corner of the restaurant. Every night I slept at different family; I am embarrassing.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080849_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After the sunset, restaurant is very busy. </p><p>There are many cars in front of the store; Natasa is busying to take care of customers.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080855_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I met Falahata at the door; he led me to climbs up the hill after the village.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080864_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Stood at the top of the hill, I could see the whole village. </p><p>This is a small village; it cannot be found from the map. </p><p>You even won’t notice the village while driving by; it looks yet tiny at the afterglow.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080868_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>        All adults, like father and Natasa’s husband and Falahata’s brother, are all in Uzbekistan; </p><p>only women, senior citizens, and children are stay in here and take care of business. </p><p>Restaurant is even busier after the afterglow;I helped dish wash to reduce their work load.</p><p> </p><p>Didn’t know how to continue the journey if there were no helps from nice Kazakh for past days. </p><p>This is an immense gratitude; at this moment, I only could help this family on dish wash.</p><p> </p><p>        The place for sleep has a wide bed which is for a number of people. </p><p>I was so happy there was a fan; unfortunately, the fan was gone at night.</p><p> </p><p>        Natasa and her family live in a RV; Nasata’s family own at least 70% of property in the village.</p><p>        The family also has 1 horse, 2 cattle, 3 dogs, and 4 cats; no matter when, animals are around you.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080851_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because slept beside the restaurant, there were many flies in the room. </p><p>So I slept in my tent in order to insulate from flies.</p><p>        A few thousand dollars tent is not porous. Although flies could not annoy me, I was all wet in the tent. </p><p>My sweat was all over the tent.</p><p> </p><p>        Sleeping inside the tent was even hotter than riding bike in the sunny day; </p><p>but as long as I leaved the tent, flies were flying toward to me.</p><p>        Finally I could not endure the hot in the tent and came out; I could not sleep until business was closed at 2AM.</p>
											<p>I didn’t get enough sleep; it was hard to sleep and kept turning my body. </p><p>Keeping imagination if I sleep under the bridge might be much cooler than here and no flies. </p><p> </p><p>I was determined to be a scientist to invent medicament to eliminate flies.</p><p><br /></p>
