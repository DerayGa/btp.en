The iron gate of the restaurant was locked, and so was Dido. </p><p>I managed to find a person sleeping in the storage room to unlock Dido.</p><p>Getting Dido back and changing clothes, I was asked if I would like to eat something or drink some tea.</p><p>Looking at my watch, it was still quite early. Everybody was either still asleep or not at work yet. </p><p>In order not to trouble anyone, I decided to eat along the road later.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080219_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While doing my nightly routine before sleep, I found my toothbrush and toothpaste were gone. </p><p>I recollected that they were left on the sink vanity in the hotel room where I stayed the day before yesterday.</p><p>Without brushing teeth properly, it would be troublesome that my toothache would come back. I just recovered…</p><p>Flossing and gargling thoroughly, I would buy a new toothbrush and toothpaste when I next saw some shops. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080230_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Riding along the well-paved main road, it even had a shoulder as a bike lane for me to ride on. </p><p>I wanted to stay on this road.</p><p>Could it be possible that that main road would take me to Almaty and all the way up to Astana?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080233_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After a short ride, a few gas stations and a signboard with “hotel, 50 meters ahead” were in sight. </p><p>If I had not slept in the restaurant last night, it could have been quite a different night.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080221_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Having breakfast at the roadside restaurant around 9:00am, I still did not read the menu but asked the waiter to order for me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080268_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The table setting was western style and always with a very large sugar jar. </p><p>The only thing I knew how to order was “tea”. Tea with sugar tasted good and helped me recover.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080269_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I got a set meal including stew potato, chicken, salad and rice stopped with white sauce – a good portion, and palatable.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080274_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was funny that when the store staff found out that I did not speak Kazak, he asked if I spoke English. </p><p>I nodded happily and said yes. Did anybody here speak English? </p><p>The answer was “no”.</p><p>If so, why did you ask me if I spoke English?</p><p> </p><p>The Kazak way of calculating bills is interesting as well. In China, the number was always rounded off. </p><p>For example, if a meal was 493 RMB, the bill would be 490 RMB.</p><p>In Kazakhstan, everything was rounded up, do there was no change back if 500 KZT was handed over for 493 KZT.</p><p> </p><p>The roadside rest area was also not too shabby, it had places for eating and shopping. </p><p>After getting new toothbrush and toothpaste, I was off.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080277_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Continuing on the main road, when I saw a policeman standing by the road, </p><p>I pointed my hand forward and loudly asked “Asatana?”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>What happened was if I kept riding on this road, I would be heading south and entering Kyrgyzstan in two days.</p><p>I had to backtrack to get to Almaty. </p><p>Turning back upset me quite a bit. Fine then, I would continue on and turn to the north when I had a chance.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080228_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Seeing a person in a car wreck on the road side in the distance, I was quite nervous. </p><p>I had been seeing animals’ bodies along the way, but please don’t let me see a human body.</p><p>Thank god, that person was a healthy man who was dismantling the car and salvaging the auto parts.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080279_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Graffiti on the wall – I could only understand the ♥ and the text smiley :-). Was that love talk?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080286_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The map in Chinese was useless and I could not read the road sign in Kazak. </p><p>The only tool could navigate with was my compass. </p><p>It silently showed me that I was moving toward midway between west and southwest.</p><p>I was lost terribly, so the heaven sent me an angel.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080296_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A motorcyclist passed by. He stopped and asked me if I spoke English. </p><p>Yes, I did. He indeed spoke English not just asking for fun.</p><p>Yingo, from Scandinavia, had traveled for five weeks on his beloved heavy motorcycle and had done 10,000 km. </p><p>We both were heading for Moscow but on different routes.</p><p>I felt embarrassed to tell him that I was lost. </p><p>Yingo checked on his map and told me that I was not terribly lost, </p><p>continuing on another 20 km, I could turn right toward the north, riding another 100 km to get back to the right road.</p><p>Taking a picture of the map for future reference, I saw a place named Kepa, and expected it to be today’s lodging.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080295_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The attractive structures with castle-like pointed towers are actually tombs. </p><p>They look more luxurious than the houses where the alive people live.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080298_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Before turning right to adjust my direction, I bought one liter of apple juice.</p><p>I had no idea if there would be towns to get supplies along the way. </p><p>Usually I was as sparing of water as possible. </p><p>Once a shop or a gas station appeared, I would buy one liter of beverage and quaffed it real quick.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080312_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I stopped for a drink and to catch my breath before leaving the well-paved main road and continued on the minor road</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080308_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Once I hit the minor road, the road became lousy and was full of potholes. What happened? Did a meteor strike the road?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080346_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080336_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Not an easy ride, but the scenery along the road was beautiful. </p><p>Golden grass was on both sides of the road. I had no idea they were pastures or weeds, </p><p>they were beautiful and waving in the wind like a golden sea.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080323_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080330_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080337_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080340_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Getting on a side road, it was less than 30 km away from Kepa. </p><p>Halfway, I was stopped by three cops with gold crowned teeth in their mouths in a sedan.</p><p>Policemen did not drive police cars. No wonder I did not see any police cars running along the road. </p><p>I thought they stopped me to cheer me up or something. It turned out that they wanted to check on my passport.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080347_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While they were browsing my passport, I asked for Kepa information.<br />I made a gesture of sleeping - any hotel in Kepa? Everybody shook their heads.<br />Then, a gesture for eating – any restaurant in Kepa? They still shook their heads.<br />REALLY? What a miserable place. <br />Then, a gesture for drinking – it could not be possible that Kepa had no shops? Finally everybody nodded.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080374_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Passing a small lake along the road, I would say it was not a lake but a pond of flood water. </p><p>The water was not clear so I had no desire to soak my feet. After taking a picture, I was off.</p><p>Dido was propped against a short tree with stiff branches. </p><p>I hit my head on the branches a few times and had to bend over to walk Dido out.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080362_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Everything gave way to the flat landscape stretching as far one could see. </p><p>Kepa was in sight and looked nice in the distance.</p><p>There were many small houses and some storage-like structures. I thought to myself, “shouldn’t it be not too backward?”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080376_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When arriving in Kepa, I could not happily tell Dido that we had arrived. </p><p>The reason was this town had deteriorated so badly.</p><p>The noisy birds in the sky were all crows. This town is located at the intersection of a road and a railroad. </p><p>How could it fall apart to such an unacceptable degree?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080383_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080389_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I got up to the bridge crossing over the railroad, a shepherd boy cried out loud, </p><p>running over and talking to me in the language I did not understand at all – it sounded exotic, didn’t it?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080391_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was not romantic whatsoever, his body language made me understand what he was saying.</p><p>He made a gesture of smoking – do you have cigarettes? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080400_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Getting into Kepa, empty streets and falling apart houses, most of which were abandoned.</p><p>There were a huge power facility and an abandoned factory house. </p><p>It seemed that this place was once prosperous with industry. How did it become today’s decaying town?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080405_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally spotting a person, I made a gesture of drinking, asking where I could find a shop?</p><p>He led me all the way to the decaying town and then opened up the factory’s iron gate. </p><p>Inside, all were large broken rusted machines. He gave me a PET bottle with water in it.</p><p>That was not what I was looking for, a shop, but I appreciated the water. </p><p>Filling up my water bottles, and drinking some water, I spoke in Kazak with poor pronunciation “where is there a shop?”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080409_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080412_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>He pointed somewhere in the town and offered to take me over. </p><p>I walked Dido following him, but he gestured me to leave Dido and I could sleep here tonight as well. </p><p>He was the first person I met in the little town. I just wanted to ask for information about a shop. </p><p>It turned out that he took me home and let me stay for one night. Fate was indeed something marvelous.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080415_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The person who took me in for tonight was named Guyweidian. He watched the abandoned factory.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080421_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080425_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought one liter of orange juice, two liters of cola, a few bags of instant noodles </p><p>and a big bag of bread at the only shop in town. After rounding up, I paid 580 KZT.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080430_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since I saw Guyweidian boiling water, I thought of buying a few bags of instant noodles. </p><p>Noodles accompanied by bread and cola sounded a nice meal.</p><p>Back in Guyweidian’s dorm, only he and his dog were left in this enormous factory large enough to employ more than 1,000 people.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080435_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080410_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While water was boiling on the stove, I offered the instant noodles,</p><p>but Guyweidian seemed to have another idea for dinner.</p><p>Before dinner, he took me to a place with a big water tube where cold water ran. </p><p>He said the water was not drinkable but I could take a sponge bath – excellent!</p><p>I fetched my towel and clothes first, cleaned up myself, and did my laundry. </p><p>The clothes were not washed in soapy water, but it was better than not washing at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080433_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The washed clothes were hung up to dry at the abandoned deck where nothing had left.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080436_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The dinner was white, short and thin noodles seasoned with black pepper and salt topped with sliced onion </p><p>– looked normal but amazingly delicious.</p><p>The sheep-poop-like pellets in my hot tea were in fact processed tea. I added a few teaspoons of sugar.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080446_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The abandoned factory did not have power and water. There were tens of PET bottles in various sizes containing water. </p><p>I had no idea the source of the water though.</p><p>Without power, the pictures were quickly uploaded and stored in my computer. </p><p>Hopefully I would find a place to recharge my camera, cell phone and other stuff needing power.</p><p>I had given up upon Internet already. As long as I could get online once in Kazakhstanduring the month of travel, I would be content.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080420_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After dinner, Guyweidian gave me a tour of the abandoned factory. </p><p>I did not understand what he said, but my guess was this place was a cement factory.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080457_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080459_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Tens of tall and huge silos lined side by side. The structure in the center seemed to be the control tower. </p><p>Nothing left in the tower except pigeon poop, feathers, and dead bodies.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080492_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As the rusted front door was opened, the birds were frightened and flew away – they were totally startled.</p><p>How long would a factory take to decay to a condition like such? 3 years, 5 years?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080463_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After entering the dirty factory house, we climbed up the steep stairs. </p><p>If you fell down the stairs, you stepped on nothing but bird poop.</p><p>The rail I needed to hold onto was also covered with bird poop. It was dangerous not to hold onto the rail.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080468_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080481_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because the factory went down, Kepa was affected and went down with it, </p><p>even though Kepa had the intersection of the railroad and the main road.</p><p>Today, there was no traffic on the road, and no train ever stopped. </p><p>I could image how relatively prosperous the town had been, but it had been long forgotten now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080484_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I could not think of a reason why people were still staying here, perhaps they could not let go.</p><p>The crows squawking and spiraling in the sky the whole day sounded sad and dead.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080473_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The abandoned factory had its own railroad, now it was overgrown with weeds. </p><p>The rusted railway tracks lay on the ground like a skeleton rotten with time.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080496_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Guyweidian watched the abandoned factory by himself. </p><p>Even he was alone, some kids or ex-coworkers would come to chat with him at times. He was not too lonely after all.</p><p>He was a 35 year old married man. His wife and two kids lived in a major city.</p><p>He did not have much to do except locking up every door and witnessing the buildings decaying day after day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080500_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>At 9:00pm, I laid my sleeping bag on the bed and was ready to sleep. </p><p>He was outside busy hammering nails till late night</p><p>Kepa was like today’s sunset – sentimental and lonely with the smell of death – beautiful but brief.
