										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-71_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Sleep quite well last night. The snack bar closes very late, while the noise of guests coming for food could be heard even on 2 or 3 am. </span></p><p>It is really hard to do this business for such bars by the roadside.</p><p>When I woke up I felt my body is fully printed by the spring bed, </p><p> </p><p>and some joints just felt being dislocated and relocated again. </p><p>I carried my towel and toothbrush to wash up. Above the washbasin in front of the shop, </p><p>there were three dragonfly-like and two moth-like insects floating on the water tank. I stared for three seconds.</p><p> </p><p>And I decided to pretend not seeing these bathing insects, and still wash up using this water. </p><p>When in Rome, do as Romans do. If I don’t adapt myself to it, how to live in Kazakhstan from now on?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080651_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The water in the bottle I prepared to drink today came from that the snack bar boiled for making tea. </p><p>Actually the un-boiled water here maybe basically not for drinking, </p><p>but people don’t care and just drink it since the source of water is very few here.</p><p><br />Drinking boiled water makes me feeling safer. However the taste is really strange. </p><p>It’s a kind of sticky feel, and it seems you are drinking the water in the aquarium.</p><p> </p><p>In order to cover up this strange taste, I added a couple of spoon of brown sugar into the bottle. It may drink better.</p><p> </p><p>Six thirty in the morning, the sun just rose on the hill. </p><p>Catch the time and start the trip in the cool morning, before it is getting hot.</p><p>Yesterday I inquired and found out that the ninety kilometers I planned to cover today is again full of up hills and down hills, </p><p>which is a highly manpower-consuming terrain.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080660_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Yesterday I bought two boxes of juice. Less than half box was left and I stored it in the refrigerator of the snack bar. </p><p>It was frozen when I take it out this morning.</p><p> </p><p>Without finding a suitable place on the packs, I take the juice on the hand, and have to wait until it is melted.</p><p>The breakfast today is one hotdog, some pieces of cookie, plus the almost empty juice. </p><p>The food in the bag is running out, so it is time to prepare for complement.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080654_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Although I connected back to the main road from the small route, </p><p>the road condition is not so good as the one lead to Kyrgyzstan that I went wrong earlier. </p><p>But it is much better than those bad roads like hit by the meteor rain.</p><p> </p><p>This is the road distance sign of Kazakhstan. It is a strut-shape angular design and has two numbers on it. </p><p>Drivers will see different numbers from different sides.</p><p>There is still more than two thousand kilometers to ride on this road. I’m just wondering where the end is of this road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080658_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The scenery here is always the same in the whole morning. </p><p>It’s a single road with the pasture of yellow short grass on left and right. Except the moorland that you don’t see its boundary, there is…</p><p>Nothing at all!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080663_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If you think the road you are riding is no big deal, fine, </p><p>this complex sign clearly describe that the next 50 kilometers is good for me to suffer.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080661_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Cars passed by occasionally. The traffic is quite low, </p><p>and it makes me hard to believe that this is a main road connecting two big cities. </p><p>The more I stay in Kazakhstan, the less I understand this country.</p><p> </p><p>The kinds of the dead animal bodies changed. Lots of snakes were flattened! </p><p>There are big one s and small ones, and besides this, I also see live scorpions and ultra big lizards crossing the road.</p><p>It looks the pasture here is quite not safe. If there is any other solution, </p><p>I will avoid camping in the outdoor wild area to prevent from any strange thing coming to sleep with me in the night.</p><p> </p><p>The sign on the road is simple. My next destination, Astana, is now within one thousand kilometers, </p><p>and is estimated to be arrived by the first decade of July.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080664_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the road there are some signs indicating the rivers, and even the bridges have been constructed formally. </p><p>However, there is not even one drop of water at all under the bridge, except sand and pasture.</p><p>The scenery around nearby is either the desert being under afforestation, or is the pasture becoming a desert.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080666_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Started from the small shop I stopped last night, I’ve covered ninety-five kilometers without any human being. </p><p>As time goes by, the sun is rising higher, while the temperature made me wet again by sweat.</p><p>When thirsty, I could do nothing but drink the sweet boiled water smell and taste strange. </p><p>Feeling really dry and thirsty under the big sun, I will drink even if there is only aquarium water available.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080667_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Human made building finally appeared again in the noon. </p><p>A shabby gas station with a grocery ceased operation. Luckily a restaurant is still open.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080668_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought one liter of soda water first. During today’s trip I’ve been imaging the feeling of drinking cold drinks later. </p><p>And this thought almost drove me crazy! When the “dream” comes true, I felt nothing but great!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080673_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dido was a poor fellow. Now I also put down the bags when I take rest at noon, </p><p>and I changed to comfortable slippers and put off the long pants as well, to take a really easy noontime rest.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080670_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For the lunch I still waived hands and fingers to the restaurant staff to prepare mine. </p><p>It’s a little bit bothering this way. They have to guess what I try to order, </p><p>and may worry about whether the meal they send is delicious to me or not.</p><p>But, no matter what the meal they provided, it is delicious because I was starving.</p><p> </p><p>The lunch was ample. The red colored soup is just like the sour soup in the dinner last night in the small shop, </p><p>in which there is a lot of vegetable slices, potato and stewed lamb.</p><p>I got spaghettis with large pieces of meat, dry and hard bread, plus icy coke.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080674_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I still felt not full yet after consuming all the food. I saw that the fried fish the quests on the next table ordered looks not bad, </p><p>so I also order one. Its very delicious to add onion cut into pieces and spread some pepper on it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080677_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Such an ample lunch charges six hundred bucks only. Although it is located in a remote place, </p><p>this restaurant is a good shop without exaggerating the price.</p><p>Any one, if any, who is full of time and come to Kazakhstan, </p><p>is suggested to come over here for the lunch with good taste and good price~</p><p>While the big sun was on the top of the sky, I had my lunch and took a short snap under the eaves of the restaurant. </p><p>There is a spring bed here like the one I slept last night, and thus I took a sufficient rest here.</p><p> </p><p>It was still early, and I didn’t mean to stay overnight here. Just took a bit longer rest. </p><p>I was ready to start at 4:00 pm, and would ride to next stop in which I had no idea if it would be more comfortable than this place.</p><p>Before I left, I asked for some water from the proprietress with my already-empty bottle, </p><p>and was informed by her that there would be hotels for the night if I keep covering another seventy kilometers.</p><p>Actually I had not been that mind if there is any hotel available or not. </p><p>Considering the current situation, the top one in my priority list was the grocery since it provides food and drink.</p><p> </p><p>The second priority is the restaurant that some more tasteful hot meal is available. </p><p>Hotel is the third one, in which I could take a comfortable bath, laundering, and an ultra long sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Even if I delayed my starting until 4:00 in the afternoon, the sun still showed its passion. </p><p>The truck drivers’ dressing is quite cool. Basically naked on the upper body, and some of them are even stripped to be only one pants left.</p><p>And they just get off the car with the pants only, walking around no matter when refueling or shopping. Very interesting picture.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080678_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It has been headwind since I left the restaurant. The up hills and down hills were like in the morning, </p><p>while the scenery has no big change as well, but it just felt much more tiring.</p><p>I went on riding for four hours and didn’t stop until I felt a bit hungry. </p><p>The tiring riding deserves some more altitude, doesn’t it?</p><p>No, I lost some. Under the infestation by the headwind, even riding on the down hills felt same as on the up hills. </p><p>It just felt riding in the glue, with the pain of sticky and no progress.</p><p> </p><p>Leaning the Dido on the rock, I took a short rest. </p><p>There is no any tree here and the ground is smooth, and I had no other choice to put the bike on.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080679_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And I walked back to the top of the hill which I just climbed and had a bird view…</p><p>It’s totally super desolate! Is it necessarily too expansive?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080682_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The sunset came at around 9:00 pm. </p><p>The horses put out to pasture walked across the road rolling up misty dust. It is like in the dream.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080703_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the quiet withered pasture around, countless locusts appeared on every side after the sun set. </p><p>The locusts are very big and roaming about everywhere silently.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080693_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The big lake I noticed on the map finally showed off. </p><p>From now on I would ride all the way to the central big cities along the lakeside. </p><p>I expected the beautiful lake view.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080700_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally, before the sun hide behind the horizon, </p><p>I arrived the small town with hotels that the restaurant proprietress mentioned.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080706_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Instead of a gas station, the first building I met here is rarely a restaurant with a long train cabin, </p><p>meantime running the hotel business.</p><p> </p><p>I ran to there and asked about the price of staying overnight, and planned to stay here if it is not too expensive. </p><p>I showed my memo pad to the staff to write the price on it, while they wrote down an Arabic number of one thousand.</p><p> </p><p>This is very very cheap. Incredibly it take only 1,000 for an overnight stay. </p><p>It took even 2,500 bucks per night when I was in the suburban Almaty, where a one-hour short stay charged 700!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080709_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I confirmed it being the price for a whole night, and then moved Dido and my luggage into the room very happily. </p><p>There is a comfortable bed and a cool electric fan.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080713_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The staff showed me the hotel environment. </p><p>Since there is no shower facility in the room, I made a gesture of a bathing and asked if I can take a shower here.</p><p> </p><p>He led me to a big bathroom. Maybe it is near the lake area, the water supply is unlimited, </p><p>and the hot water came in an endless flow when I turned on the handle.</p><p>Finally I found a solution for my dirty clothing. I just left a clean pants for myself, </p><p>and put all other clothes, no matter those for sleeping or for riding, into the hot water with washing powder.</p><p> </p><p>Making the clothing wholly clean. Meanwhile, I took a very comfortable bath, </p><p>and feeling totally refreshed when the towel washed away all the dust cumulated on my skin for a few days.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080715_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went to the train cabin restaurant for the dinner. Most people here have their dinner after 10:00 pm. </p><p>It was crowded in it and the business was prosperous. There must be some reason for it attracting customers.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080717_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I really hope that my Kazakhstan language could improve faster. </p><p>Still unable to read the menu, however I recorded the comparative name of the food I ordered every time after the meal. </p><p>Then I could order that food next time when I would like to eat.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080719_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I told the grandma to send me some delicious meals. </p><p>I really admire when I saw other guests ordering meals fluently. </p><p>The only one thing I could order by myself is the milk tea.</p><p>Kazakhstan people actually look like European plus Russian. Asian faces are seldom seen. Here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080724_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Forgetting to make the gesture, the milk tea that I ordered one bottle every time came only one cup this time. </p><p>The delicious bread is all you can eat, and the milk tea is all you can drink.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080723_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The main dish was the stewed lamb with spaghettis. The lamb meal here was treated very well. </p><p>No offensive smell, and the quality quite good. Fresh and juicy. I could eat to the full with the lamb with spaghetti.</p><p> </p><p>I always take onion chips when I eat meat. Even though not for preventing the decayed teeth, </p><p>remember to make tooth brushed after the meal for a good mouth smell.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1080736_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finishing this meal fully. The whole body was clean to spread good smell, </p><p>feeling luckily with a round tripe and with the clothing under drying.</p><p>Today I covered two day’s distance at a time. Kazakhstan is just like China that it is not windy in the morning, </p><p>and begins wind blowing after the noontime. Taking a good rest tonight, and tomorrow I will have the lake tour.</p><p><br /></p>
