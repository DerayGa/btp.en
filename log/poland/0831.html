school.  I was just waking up then.  </span></p><p>I waved to him for good-bye.  </p><p>Time for breaks goes by so fast; I felt I had just arrived at Pozana yesterday afternoon with the sun setting behind me.  </p><p>I am leaving Pozana early this morning; I am a bit reluctant to leave.  </p><p>I stayed here for almost a week, there are a lot more places worth visiting that I haven’t gone yet.  </p><p>Poland also has other beautiful cities worth visiting; hopefully I will get to come back later in the future.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170613_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Goose posted a message for me on the door; it says </p><p>“Deray, Have a safe trip.  Bye, Good Luck.” </p><p>  </p><p>When I turned the paper over, Goose wrote a big “GO” on the back.  </p><p>I have traveled for more than 4 months now; I am beginning to miss my home. </p><p>I want to go home now.  I am thinking about my semi-chaotic room, </p><p>the kitchen I can cook in, and the adorable Misasa. </p><p> </p><p>In one trip, I picked up and took all my stuff downstairs to the garage Dido was parked.  </p><p>I found a postcard from Gorilla in the rear clamp of Dido.  </p><p>If I hadn’t met Gorilla and Goose at Poznan, this trip would be a different story.  </p><p>I probably wouldn’t have stopped at Poznan.  </p><p>I would still be riding Dido somewhere else with Dido’s bike chain going kalakala.  </p><p>Thank you for your help, and thank you for your hospitality.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170619_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I noticed the huge layers of clouds as soon as I walked out of the dormitory door.  </p><p>The sky is also dark and windy.  I do not feel good about this.                      </p><p>Goose and Guerilla both said it will rain today.  </p><p>The weather report said it will rain around noon.  </p><p>I am hoping as long as I leave the rain storm area in Poznan before noon, </p><p>I will be fine.  Please give me a chance to get out of this rain cloud area! </p><p> </p><p>Zip tie is so convenient and easy to use. </p><p>I used zip ties to strap up the broken support bar that is holding up the back knapsack.  </p><p>This way, I can put the laptop back into the back knapsack.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170621_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I only managed to carry the laptop on top of the front bag for one day without any accidents.  </p><p>Now with the laptop back in the back knapsack, </p><p>I don’t have to worry about the laptop flying off when it was on top of the front bag.  </p><p> </p><p>I left a little before 9am.  </p><p>So if the weather report is correct, I still got 3 hours to get out of the Poznan area before the storm hits.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170623_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>First, I need to look for the connecting road to get out of the city.  </p><p>When I was studying the map yesterday, I found if I follow Red 92 way,</p><p>I can get to the Poland/Germany border.  The distance is about 190km (118 miles).  </p><p> </p><p>This sign showing a little boy with his hat and backpack is different from the previous sign of a little girl</p><p>in braids holding a red balloon.  Those signs mean be aware of children crossing; they are all very adorable signs.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170624_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It has started to rain, although very little rain has came down.  </p><p>It is still some time until noon, those rain started early.  I was still in Poznan trying to figure out the road signs.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170626_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Left?  Right?</p><p> </p><p>When I found the correct connecting roads, the rain poured down.  </p><p>I got soaked immediately.  The rain came so fast; there was no place to hide.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170631_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally there is a place under the bride where I can hide from the rain a bit.  </p><p>The rain doesn’t look like it will stop anytime soon so I put the waterproof covers onto the knapsacks.</p><p> </p><p>I will have to ride in the rain.  It is uphill right here, so all the water flows down here collecting into huge puddles.  </p><p>The trucks passing by me drove so fast and splashed me all over with dirty water from the rain.  </p><p>I left wearing clean and dry clothing.  In one hour, I managed to be dirty again.  </p><p>My shoes and socks got wet as well, so I will be riding with my slippers on.</p><p> </p><p>I left while it was still raining but the rain fall slowed down a bit soon after.  </p><p>After I have been looking at the signs for awhile, </p><p>I understand that the white circle with the black letters PL and D means the border of Poland and Germany.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170632_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Right now I am still 169km (105 miles) from Poland and Germany border.  </p><p>I am about 276km (172miles) from Berlin, Germany’s capitol city.  </p><p>Because of the rain and the wind is blowing against me, it is difficult to ride all the way to the border in one day.  </p><p>So whatever distance I ride today will be it.  I will ride the rest tomorrow to get to Germany.</p><p> </p><p>The clouds are so low to the ground.  There is only a little bit distance between the field and the sky.  </p><p>The highest temperature it got today is 16C (60F), so it was a bit cold today.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170634_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>My whole body shakes from being drenched in the rain and the wind blowing against me.  </p><p>I stopped and moved around a bit to warm up.  </p><p>I put some pop music on before I started up again so I won’t be as cold.</p><p> </p><p>It feels like the trees are saying goodbye to me on the road leaving Poznana.  </p><p>Because the colder fall season is coming, if I plan to camp again I will have to take out the sleeping bag for warmth.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170635_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I didn’t even ride 40km (25mile) when noon rolled around.  </p><p>But I left Poznan already; I no longer see signs going into or out of Poznana.  </p><p>There isn’t a lot of food in my bags, my stomach is also empty, and it is time to buy some more food.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170637_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought a huge loaf of bread and 4 different flavors of cookies at this country store.  </p><p>I told myself to eat half loaf of bread first before I started up on the cookies.  </p><p>It is more important to fill the stomach first.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170639_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Great, the more I ride to the west, the weather looks better.  </p><p>There are still a lot of clouds in the sky, but the color is no longer black.  </p><p>The clouds are now white, and I can see some blue skies as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170644_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As soon as the waterproof covers dried up, I took them off the knapsacks.  </p><p>Now the bags will be drying in the cold blowing wind.  </p><p>The clothing I was wearing already dried up from the ride.  </p><p>The only place I see any evidence of rain was the ones on my glasses.</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t sweat any today because the cool weather is a little bit too cold.  </p><p>Too bad the clothing already got drenched with dirty water from passing by trucks, </p><p>or I would be completely clean from today’s ride.  </p><p> </p><p>The closer to the border, the livelier it becomes.  </p><p>There are also money exchange, rest area, hotel, restaurant, gas stations along the way.  </p><p>No wonder it is the road going into Europe.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170646_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Once I leave Poland, I will be using Euros.  </p><p>There are lots of 24 hour money exchange places along the way.  </p><p>The sign Kantor means money exchange.  The money exchange rate here isn’t as good as the ones in Poznan city.  </p><p>But the number of stores increases as I get closer to the border. </p><p>It is about time to spend some Euros. </p><p>I hope I don’t try to figure out the Euro to NTW conversion every time I spend money.</p><p> </p><p>Otherwise, I wouldn’t buy or eat anything.  </p><p> </p><p>I got very sleepy around 1:30pm.  </p><p>This is probably due to riding in the rain and the fact I didn’t get to bed until 2am last night.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170656_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was half asleep by the time I reached this bus stop.  </p><p>It is very dangerous to ride while my mind can’t distinguish between dream and reality at this point.  </p><p>It is very stupid to fall off the bike from sleeping or hitting by a car.  </p><p>So I kept looking for a place to stop.  I was very excited when I found this bus stop.  </p><p>The nearly enclosed place provides warmth.  I lay flat on the bench and took something to be my pillow.  </p><p>I was asleep within seconds.</p><p> </p><p>I slept here for an hour and half.  I finally felt a lot better.  </p><p>The sky darkened when I got up and rode again.  I really miss the bright sunlight.</p><p> </p><p>Other than money exchange places along the road, there are tons of places selling wood windmill and stone carving.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170660_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170662_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are bunch of stone carved chicken, sheep, pork, </p><p>and cow on the grass along with wood made items with no price tag on them.  </p><p>However, I wouldn’t buy any anyway.  The dark cloud covered area stops here.  </p><p> </p><p>It is very clear where the dark cloud ends and bright sky starts.  </p><p>Once I pass this hill, the sky won’t be so dark anymore.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170665_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I got a little frightened right here by the sign that says be careful of crazy cow.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170671_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Don’t get blind sighted, the cows are made of cardboard so is the sign that says be careful of crazy cows.  </p><p>Those signs are advertisement for this beer company.</p><p> </p><p>This 2 stars hotel looks very comfortable, shouldn’t be very expensive either.  </p><p>After all, I am still in Poland, nothing can compare to the high prices in Europe.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170672_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The longer I travel the less chance I get to stay in a hotel.  </p><p>I once would have considered this hotel being one of my sleeping places.</p><p> </p><p>But now I continue peddling along looking for my real sleeping spot.  </p><p>The trees all stand up straight in one row.  This feels like Poland doesn’t want me to leave.  </p><p>I stayed so long in Poland, and always had nice sunshine days.  </p><p>The moment I try to leave, the sky rains and the wind blows.  Don’t keep me here!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170673_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This restaurant sign looks like the restaurant has lots of delicious food.  </p><p>The sign also says it takes Euro and money exchange service.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170677_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The money exchange rates don’t look very good from most places along the road, this one included. </p><p>I guess it is easy to get money exchange business along this road so there is no reason </p><p>for the stores to compete with one another on the exchange rates. </p><p> </p><p>I was curious so I went in to see what money exchange place looks like. </p><p>In addition to Euro exchange, they also offer exchanges for East Europe countries.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170681_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I still got enough ZLIT on me.  </p><p>I will have to exchange USD for Euro later on with not so favorable exchange rates.  </p><p>I plan to get to Paris in 10 days.</p><p> </p><p>Unless there are any accidents, I don’t plan to stay in a hotel for the rest of the trip.  </p><p>My small hope is to have a big meal, but I will have to see how much money I have got then.</p><p> </p><p>Around 6pm, I finally stopped at a big gas station.  </p><p>There are very few lone gas stations along the way.  Most gas stations are included in a rest area.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170686_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though it doesn’t look very impressive from the outside, this store carries lots of items including gas. </p><p>I am not sure which gas is used for vaporized gas stove.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170688_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I didn’t have any extra plastic bottles with me, and the price of gas is really expensive.  </p><p>For 1 L (0.26 gallon) of gas it costs $50NT ($1.56USD).  </p><p> </p><p>There is a huge restaurant in the gas station with lot of people in there. </p><p>There are also electronic games in the gas station. </p><p>I am very impressed with how prosper and civilized Europe is.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170690_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I took my water bottle to the bathroom planning to get some water and to wash my face; </p><p>even the bathroom has tons of stuff.  </p><p>There is washer, dryer, and shower service in the bathroom paid by whoever uses the service.  </p><p>The gas station is 24 hour service.  So it would be easy to find a spot to sit and spend the night here.  </p><p>There is heating in the building and free charging for electricity.  </p><p>This means as long as I can figure out where to put the bike, I can stay in any of the gas stations.  </p><p>I want to get closer to the border before the sun goes down.</p><p> </p><p>That way, I wouldn’t have to ride as far tomorrow.  </p><p>Since Poland is also in the European Union, maybe it wouldn’t be so complicated to get into Germany from Poland. </p><p>  </p><p>I found this empty house around 8pm.  </p><p>There is some damage to the outside, but the roof is still there.  </p><p>Even if the weather gets bad at night, I still got a roof over my head protecting me from the rain and the wind.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170695_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The wall is covered with vine, there is also tire tracks near the door.  </p><p>It feels like no one will come here, but I still check out the area before making my decision about staying here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170702_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I opened the first door, the space is small like the size of a wine cellar.  </p><p>It contains a wood table and 2 twin sized mattress. </p><p>If I sleep here, I would be able to sleep on top of a mattress tonight.  </p><p>It looks like the perfect stop, but something doesn’t feel right about this place.</p><p> </p><p>This feels like the scene of a scary movie.  There is another little room next to this one.  </p><p>I was shocked when I opened the 2nd little room door, there is a pair of clean white canvas sneakers.  </p><p>How come there are clean canvas shoes here?  </p><p>This doesn’t make sense with the surrounding area.</p><p> </p><p>My brain started making up stories… once there is a traveler who stopped here to camp.  </p><p>At the middle of the night someone came to kidnap him including his luggage.  </p><p>The only thing left here is his clean sneakers.  </p><p>I was pretty impressed with my own imagination, but I also left here quickly. </p><p>It felt like I just got away from some horrible disaster.  I continue riding toward the west.</p><p> </p><p>It is very rare to see empty houses along this route. </p><p>I reached another rest area in about half of an hour.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170713_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>With the sky getting darker, neon lights from the stores shine through them.  </p><p>The 24 hour signs and lights attract me.  I just have to look at the lights to get a warm feeling. </p><p>Leading Dido along the huge glass window, I see people enjoying their dinner in the warm yellow lights.  </p><p>I get hungry by just looking at them.  </p><p> </p><p>I circled around the building to get an idea what this place is like.  </p><p>I plan to find a place here to sleep tonight since this is a 24 hour establishment; </p><p>the chance of me getting kicked out is slim.  </p><p>The parking lot has tons of 18 wheelers parked there.  </p><p>The gas station is also pretty big.  In comparison, this little hut seems very small even though it is pretty big.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170716_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is clean floor and furniture in the hut.  </p><p>Other than me, no one comes near the hut. </p><p>Everyone goes straight to the restaurant right after they get out of their car and vice versa.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170721_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I slept on the floor of this hut for free tonight.  </p><p>I was completely out by 9pm.  It was pretty cold during the day, and at night time the temperature definitely dropped a lot.  </p><p>I am lucky I have my tent and sleeping bag keeping me warm. </p><p> </p><p>I slept in front of Dido’s front wheel.  </p><p>Dido leaned against the fence part of the hut.  </p><p>This is my last night in Poland.  In previous passing countries I got lots of help from the locals. </p><p> By the time I reached Poland, I got help from Taiwanese people who is studying here.  </p><p>To Goose, Gorilla, and everyone studying hard, </p><p>thanks for your help the last few days, and I hope everyone can finish their studies soon and be back to Taiwan. </p><p><br /></p>
