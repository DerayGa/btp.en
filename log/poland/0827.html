										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-131_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The biggest problem has been solved in Poland, </span></p><p>after both the front and the rear tires of the bike were changed.  </p><p>All that are left are just small things that need to be fixed; </p><p>Goose and Guerilla together fixed the rest of the problems.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160594_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because of my stupidity, I forgot to unplug a wire on the bike when I changed the tires. </p><p>I kept wondering why the front tire wouldn’t come off, was it caught on something?  </p><p>So after my very hard pull, the wire that connects the night-light on the bike was broken.  </p><p> </p><p>The wire has been broken for over a month,</p><p>I didn’t want to mention this since I was afraid people would worry </p><p>about me and I coudln’t fix this wire immediately. </p><p> </p><p>I was pretty sure I would hear lots of concerned comments about </p><p>riding at night without any lights to guide me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160575_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So I know I have to find a resting place everyday before nightfall, and not ride in the dark.  </p><p>I have been safe all the way so far, and finally I can ride normally with everything fixed.  </p><p>Guerilla connects the positive and the negative wires back, </p><p>using electrical tape to tape the ends.  Now the bright bike headlight is working normally again.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160589_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Goose and Guerilla both attend medical school here in Poland.  </p><p>They are very self-dependent on DIY things such as fixing the bike. </p><p>Really, one needs to know how to do everything when living overseas.</p><p> </p><p>The front carrier lost a screw for over three months by now, </p><p>and now the whole screw hole is completely flat.  </p><p>I had thought there was no way to fix this problem, but Guerilla figured out a solution.  </p><p>Guerilla put plastic tubing with screw line inside the screw hole, </p><p>and then used a smaller screw for the hole.  </p><p> </p><p>After that we used zip ties to fasten the carrier.  This is another problem solved.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160587_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were other things such as the meter counter that was loose. </p><p>I had secured the meter counter with plastic tape, </p><p>but now the meter counter is secured with double sided tape plus zip ties.  </p><p>After changing to the new rear tire, the bike makes this clocky noise.  </p><p>Guerilla suggests changing to a new chain, and then readjust the speed changer, </p><p>this sounds like a huge task at hand.  </p><p> </p><p>I was worried this would take too much of their time so we decided not to do this part for now,</p><p>considering Goose and Guerilla are starting school tomorrow,</p><p>and facing heavy classes at the medical school ahead.  </p><p>So the bike fixing up stops at this point for now.</p><p> </p><p>Today we aren’t driving the Fiat around town; rather we are taking the bus.  </p><p>The bus uses the same type of tickets as the electronic bus, which is counted by amount of time riding the bus. </p><p>In the same amount of time there is no restriction on how many bus changes one can make.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160571_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the future when I walk around town I would probably take the bus as well, </p><p>so I asked Goose to show me once how to take the bus, so I would know how to ride the bus. </p><p>The bus stop has signs showing which car would stop here.  </p><p>The white bus with black wording car is one type, the black bus with white wording is the night bus, </p><p>and the red bus is the special bus.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160595_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The destination is a huge church in the desert; we can reach it by taking bus 63. </p><p>Inside the bus, there is a sign showing which stops this bus makes, and how long it takes to go to each stop.  </p><p>In general, it takes 1-3 minutes between each stop.  </p><p>This way, the rider can figure out how long one needs for the bus ticket.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160605_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The small print below the bus stop is the street name, and it also includes other information for bus change.</p><p> </p><p>The connecting area in the bus has wide space, there is total of three bus doors,</p><p>no designation which one is for boarding and exiting.  </p><p> </p><p>Whenever a bus reaches a stop, one must press a button outside the bus before the door opens for boarding, </p><p>the same goes for exiting the bus.  The driver is only responsible for driving the bus.  </p><p>He is not responsible for opening/closing the doors, selling tickets, or inspecting the tickets.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160610_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Riding the bus and the electrical bus is depended upon one’s conscious; it is very easy not to pay the fair.  </p><p>Because some people have monthly or yearly bus passes, </p><p>they do not have to insert their ticket every time they board a bus.  </p><p>The people with monthly or yearly passes only have to show their ticket when someone asks to inspect their tickets.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160615_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>One buys the ticket before they board the bus, </p><p>you can easily purchase tickets in the little stall near by, buy 10 gets 1 free.  </p><p>After you board the bus, you insert the ticket, and no one watches you.  </p><p>Once awhile someone asks to inspect your ticket, </p><p>I am not sure how much he or she will fine you for no ticket.</p><p> </p><p>The bus fare gets cheaper as time goes on.  Every 10 minutes is one unit,</p><p>the price is $1.3Zit approximately $15NT ($0.5USD)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160619_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For $15NT, one can ride the bus for approximately 10 minutes.  </p><p>Counting after one boards the bus, it is about 5 stops or so.  </p><p>If one submits 2 tickets when they board the bus, then one can ride about 30 minutes. </p><p>If one submits 3 tickets, then one can ride 1-hour bus in one setting.  </p><p>There is also one unit for 30 minutes ticket available,</p><p>this way one would not need to submit 2 tickets when they board the bus.  The student ticket is half price.</p><p> </p><p>The yearly bus pass is amazing, approximately $200Zit ($73USD), average $2USD/day.  </p><p>The yearly pass is paid off with just a ride every other day. </p><p>In addition, the yearly pass has no limit on what time one can take the bus, and the quantity of the rides.</p><p> </p><p>At first, one feels it is troublesome to use timing for bus price unit, </p><p>but with the same ticket under the same time unit one can change to any other bus.  </p><p>Besides, the longer the bus ride goes, the cheaper it is, thus this type of bus fair calculation do benefit the riders.</p><p> </p><p>I am curious if any other country other than Poland use this type of time unit bus calculation.</p><p> </p><p>The sign at the bus stop states clear what time the bus arrives.  </p><p>The left is weekday bus, the middle is the Saturday bus, and the right side is the Sunday bus.  </p><p>The bus schedule is from 5am to 11pm everyday.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160620_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The right side listing shows the stops the bus has made.  </p><p>The bold wording with arrow next to it is the name of this particular stop.  </p><p>And the sign also shows the amount of time one needs between the following stops. </p><p>The current location is Katedra stop, which is the desert area in the middle of a river.  </p><p>There are also two very old and pretty churches near by.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160623_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After getting off the bus, one will see the pointy church building.  </p><p>To get across the street one takes the underground walkway.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160624_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are some graffiti on the walls of the underground walkway, but in general the whole area is clean.  </p><p>Walking in Europe, one usually sees a beautiful church building around any corner.  </p><p>Walking in the street of Poland, one sees beautiful girls walking by any time, it is good to be alive.</p><p> </p><p>This is the entrance to the church.  There are two buildings to the church.  </p><p>The left is the one over 1000years old and hasn’t been destroyed by war, still in top condition.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160626_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The right church is one with twin pointy tops with a priest delivering a sermon.  </p><p>The Roman Catholic Pop John Paul 2nd has also visited this church in the past.  </p><p>Too bad this church was partly destroyed in the Second World War, and has been reconstructed.  </p><p>The exterior looks newer, although everything inside is ancient including the sitting stool.</p><p> </p><p>This is the church on the left, built in 968A.D., count with your fingers to see how old it is.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160641_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This is memorial statue left from Pope John Paul 2nd’s visit.  </p><p>The little oil lamp on the bottom is a tradition of Poland.  </p><p>For Halloween in the US people eat pumpkin and ask for candy.  In Poland, people visit graveyard and light a lamp.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160630_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>In the evening, there is a lamp lighted everywhere; it would be hard to forget this kind of scenery.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160644_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1367" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the front of the big church, it is built with red bricks.  </p><p>The top areas are all spring grass color, </p><p>not sure if this is from oxidation or if they selected this type of building material on purpose.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160636_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The stained glass window from the outside looks normal, </p><p>but once inside, one can see the light shinnying in with lots of colors. </p><p>The outside is already pretty, but the inside is amazing. </p><p> </p><p>The front entrance is very low key, it is also very rare for me to visit the inside of a building on this trip.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160652_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The entrance has two hanging lights; those are only lighted up in the evening.  </p><p>At the same time, the church has special lightening system at nighttime.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160829_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Normally this is where I stop talking about the church,</p><p>but today is different, this is just the beginning of my introduction.</p><p> </p><p>Because I am not very knowledgeable in religious matters, </p><p>I am not going to talk about anything other than normal things, just in case it becomes a laughing stock. </p><p> </p><p>If there is anyone with Catholic background and will supplement information regarding these photos,</p><p>I will be very grateful.</p><p> </p><p>There will be more photos at the bottom than words, please browse at your leisure. </p><p>Once I get supplement information, I will explain photos one by one so everyone can be informed.</p><p> </p><p>Before we enter, let’s mention basic manners in visiting a church.  </p><p>Shorts, tshirt, hats, and shades are frowned upon inside a church.  </p><p>In addition, regardless how dark it is inside, do not use flash while taking pictures.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160817_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Lets start,</p><p>The carving above the front entrance.  </p><p>By looking at the color of these carving they should be silver, but probably oxidized already.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160654_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The carving on either side of the front entrance is carved with detail. </p><p>I haven’t even gone inside and already can feel the religious feel.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160819_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160823_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This feels similar to the wall painting in Tibet, other than being art item, those paintings also tell stories.  </p><p>Each painting tells a history or a Bible story. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160836_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If the photos are a little pixilated, please accept them as they are. </p><p> </p><p>Looking out of the windows after entering the church, </p><p>the sunlight looks too bright compared to the environment from inside the church.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160833_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160655_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The stained glass window that isn’t any special now displays its colorful glory from the inside.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160792_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>從外面看不出端倪的彩繪玻璃，一幅幅都展現出了她的美麗姿態。</p><p><span data-img-src="../../_Media/p1160799_med.jpeg" data-img-src-hr="../../_Media/p1160799_med_hr-3.jpeg" data-alt="" data-width="640" data-height="1033" style="width:640px;

they have yearly rowing competition here.  </p><p>There is also a place for people to run and look around, very good for people to ride their bikes here as well.</p><p> </p><p>The very elegant Indian restaurant next to the lake, time for my big meal.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160892_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>People who are hungry please look away or go get something to eat before looking at the rest of the photos.</p><p> </p><p>This is the menu, do you understand it?  The meals are under $30ZIT ($11 USD), approximately $400NT each.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160896_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is all curry meals here; there is lamb, fish, and chicken.  </p><p>There is no pork or beef, but unlimited rice.  When one is hungry this will be a great meal.</p><p> </p><p>While here, I should explain other European nation’s pricing.  </p><p>The restaurants that don’t provide drinking water are the norm.  </p><p>In a normal Italian restaurant, a glass of drinking water cost $8 Euro ($2.90USD), approximately $300NT. </p><p> </p><p>A bottle of 500cc Coca Cola is approximately $14 Euro ($20USD) </p><p>or $600NT when purchased at a small side vendor in Italy.</p><p> </p><p>The cost of living in Europe is very high,</p><p>just to think when I traveled around France for 51 days cost $100,000NT ($3333USD), </p><p>approximately $2000NT ($60USD) each day.</p><p> </p><p>Besides I stayed in the hotel everyday, and it was in July and August,</p><p>the busiest time to travel.  Although it was very cheap back then.</p><p> </p><p>The average meal price on the menus will stay similar after arriving to Europe, </p><p>except now all the money changes to Euro.  It would be hard to eat a meal less than $100Euro ($150USD).</p><p> </p><p>After looking at the cost of living in Europe, </p><p>the cost of living and traveling in Poland is pretty cheap in comparison.  </p><p>The cost of traveling cheaply in Poland for a month is the equivalent of traveling for a week in any other European countries.</p><p> </p><p>The appetizer is this fried shrimp, this is pretty good.  </p><p>However, one has to be careful eating seafood in Polish cities that are not near any body of water, </p><p>it is common to get stomach ach.  The salmon sold here is this weird brownish color.</p><p> </p><p>The seafood sold in the market is from when they are fresh all the way to ready to go bad, </p><p>and the price is expensive as well.  </p><p>The seafood does not come off the shelf until they are to the point of getting smelly, </p><p>but they aren’t tossed away.  They are then smoked and sold again.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160903_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>There are three types of seasoning, a green and two brownish ones, one of the seasoning is spicy and delicious. </p><p>I can eat just 3 bowls of rice alone with the spicy sauce.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160901_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Of course with today’s good meal I don’t need to eat just spicy sauce with rice.  </p><p>I am hungry again just by looking at this picture. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160910_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Indian food doesn’t look appetizing, but every meal is delicious.</p><p> </p><p>After writing so many travel journals, </p><p>I found I am not very good talking about two types of things, one is art, and the second is food.</p><p> </p><p>Every time I see an art piece, what I write doesn’t describe what I feel even to 1%.  </p><p>This is the same with the meals I eat.  I am wondering how can I describe this is a tasty meal?</p><p> </p><p>This is no wonder in the Chinese Chef picture every time when they eat a delicious meal; </p><p>they have pictures of dragons and phoenix flying. </p><p>I know the picture looks ridiculous, but for the people who are eating that meal that is how they really feel.</p><p>Traveling is a great thing to do, however, I highly do not recommend traveling with big groups.</p><p> </p><p>There are two types of self-traveling, one is by self, and one is with friends.</p><p>Independent traveling is another feel, opening one’s view, and everything learned, </p><p>especially when one returns after traveling for so long.   </p><p> </p><p>People ask what do you feel after traveling to so many places?</p><p>Even if you can’t answer that question, it is ok, because inside your heart you know what you saw.  </p><p>When you tell people what you learned is not the same anymore,</p><p>and people who are listening can’t understand what you felt on your travels. </p><p>  </p><p>Finally it isn’t necessary to write the travel blogs.  </p><p>It takes more effort to write these than riding the bikes with the time spent organizing the blogs. </p><p> </p><p>There has not been one day where I willingly wrote these blogs with details, </p><p>using so many words and photos to describe the details; this is harder than fighting an alligator.</p><p> </p><p>I rather fight with an alligator than write these blogs.  </p><p>With the time spend organizing these blogs, I rather go outside to breath the fresh air and walk around the town.</p><p> </p><p>Every time I write the blogs I pretend I am writing to Misasa, </p><p>this is because when I get older and forgets, at least these can be memories for me.</p><p> </p><p>Because I am sad I couldn’t take Misasa with me on this trip, so there is energy for me to write blog after blog.  </p><p>I feel bad not taking her with me, thus I use these blogs to show her what I saw and see. </p><p> </p><p>On a side note, there is no possibility to publish a book from this trip since I wasn’t looking for money on this trip, </p><p>and then why publish a book to start an argument.</p><p> </p><p>The people who like travel can read them through the internet, and cut down less trees, </p><p>print less paper, and let the world be greener.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160874_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p>
