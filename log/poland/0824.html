										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-128_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">In one breath, I slept three days worth.  Regardless how loud the rain sounded, it couldn’t fight my sleepyness. </span></p><p>I fell deep into sleep, the kind of sleep where you don’t realize where you are when you wake up.</p><p> </p><p>The rain stopped early in the morning, although there were still some </p><p>dark clouds covering the sky so it seems like it might rain again.  </p><p>Goose called this morning and said it will rain today, </p><p>and all I can wish is it won’t rain anymore so I can ride safely to Poznana.</p><p> </p><p>Even though rain has stopped, but there is still one annoying thing, the wind is blowing very hard.  </p><p>The wind is blowing in opposite to the direction I am traveling, so the whole day I rode against the wind.</p><p> </p><p>I kept thinking the earlier I arrive at Poznana so I can rest comfortably for two days, but it didn’t work that way.  </p><p>I rode slowly the 150Km (93 miles) to Poznana.  </p><p>I had planned to arrive at Poznana in the afternoon, however by the time I arrived at Poznana it was close to dark.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150900_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The Red #2 freeway I had been on for half of Poland is now under reconstruction.  </p><p>They are planning to use Poznana as the center which connects Berlin on the left and Warsaw on the right. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150904_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though reconstruction isn’t finished yet and only part of the way is accessible, it cuts down on the traffic flow.  </p><p>It is safer with fewer cars on the road.</p><p> </p><p>Even if there are lots of cars it is still ok, Polish people follow rules when driving. </p><p>The crazy drivers seen in Kazakhstan and Russia are gone now.  The speed limit here is half of what it is in Russia.</p><p> </p><p>Traveling over 120 days there are some things that are broken such as the carriage thing on the front of the bike. </p><p>When I was at China I found it was getting loose so I decided to have it weld in permanently.</p><p> </p><p>After shaking on the whole trip from the unpaved road, two screws still fell out even after being welded in.  </p><p>For one of the holes I used substitute screw to lock it in, </p><p>but for the other hole the screw the screw grain line has gone completely flat,</p><p>I can’t even lock it in with another screw anymore.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150911_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is another matter that troubles me even more; the supporting bar is about to break.  </p><p>The five big bags each have their own carrier connecting to the supporting bar.  </p><p>If the supporting bar breaks, then there is nowhere I can put the 5 bags.  </p><p>In addition, if just one side of the supporting bar breaks, the weight of the bike will be lop-sided.  </p><p>So if just one side of the supporting bar breaks, then there is nowhere to put that one side’s bag.  </p><p>Right now I don’t’ know any other way to carry those bags with me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150913_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This problem happens where the weight is the heaviest on the back big bag.  </p><p>When I realized it this morning the supporting bar is separating with the bag.  </p><p>This scared me so much I tried to figure out how to lessen the weight.  </p><p>Opening the bag, I took out the easier to carry but the heaviest item as well, the laptop, </p><p>this should lessen the weight on the supporting bar.  But now the problem is where can I put the laptop?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150909_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Scratching my head for a while, there is no place to put this, </p><p>so I ended up putting it on top of the bags in the front.  </p><p>I have to be careful when I ride the bike just in case if this flies out when I ride, </p><p>then there is no laptop for me to write the travel journals.了。</p><p> </p><p>The Red #2 freeway ends here, probably changed to A2 freeway.  </p><p>The rest of the way I am taking Red #92 freeway.  </p><p>The one I had been riding, E30, from Belarus ends here as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150926_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the reconstruction freeway; there are 100s of Km from here to Warsaw.  </p><p>The estimated finish time is 2010.</p><p> </p><p>By then the flight from Warsaw to Berlin will decrease, the flight will go to Poznana instead.  </p><p>Then Poznana will become a world trade center and the economy will increase as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150928_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I am hungry now, time to eat, looking for food in the mini mart along the street.</p><p>There is a fan inside.  During the summer time Poland will sell out their fans.  </p><p>Today is a good sunny day, indoor and outdoor both have cool weather.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150929_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking around I decided to buy the same lemon soda I got yesterday.  </p><p>Yesterday I paid for $5.5Zit ($2USD), and the storeowner also gives me a free bottle of water.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150932_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Today, the exact same lemon soda is just $2.5Zit ($1USD)!  </p><p>Even though purchasing beverages in a restaurant is always higher than in a grocery store, </p><p>but one cannot stop being suspicious considering the price is doubled at the restaurant! </p><p>In addition, I also purchased 3 ice creams, 2 chocolate and one strawberry. </p><p>I sat in front of the store finishing my lunch consisted of ice cream and half bottle of lemon soda.  </p><p> </p><p>I also ate the two savory breads I purchased yesterday.  </p><p>At first, it was strange eating those, but after awhile I got used to it.  </p><p>Besides, the savory bread also adds to the salt content I lost in my sweat.  </p><p> </p><p>After finishing my ice cream, I purchased some fruit from the street stands.  </p><p>Yesterday when I saw all those apple trees I just want to eat them.  </p><p>This bald man with shades doesn’t look like a fruit seller, but he is.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150946_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Picking up 2 apples, the scale is the traditional scale. </p><p>Putting the two apples in the holder and use traditional weight to measure.  This is probably used over 100 years ago.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150947_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two apples one bigger than the other, grabbing a handful of coins letting the boss pick out what he is charging me, </p><p>he only picked up $2.15Zit ($0.80USD).</p><p> </p><p>In Poland, coins become useful again, </p><p>hopeful there are chances to pick up loose change on the road again. </p><p> </p><p>After eating my apples, I continue my way toward Poznana.  </p><p>Because I am riding against the wind today, the speed is really slow.  </p><p>Thus I won’t stop at lunchtime to write the travel journals, I will wait until I am at Poznana.</p><p> </p><p>Other than the music I am listing when I was riding, I also heard this weird blowing sound.  </p><p>I stop the bike and turned off the iPod, there was a bad feeling inside of me.  </p><p>I figure I might have blew a tire, but it probably wasn’t as easy as blowing a tire.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150950_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Luckily there was a bus stop in the front; too bad the all-clear design couldn’t provide some shade for me.  </p><p>This time the tire blew on the front, which originally was the originally poor condition back tire that I moved to the front, </p><p>but this tire blew again anyway.</p><p> </p><p>This time the tire blew wasn’t because something got stuck, </p><p>but it is from the tire being rubbed down with the inner tubing blew as well.  </p><p>This is why when I ride on the road the weird windy sound.  </p><p> </p><p>This is too bad, the tire is not even worn yet and the tire already got rubbed to a hole.  </p><p>This is the maximum for this tire, may it rest in piece.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150963_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking from the inside out, this is where the spot got rubbed bare when I changed tire last time.  </p><p>No surprise this is where tire blew again, light can even pass through the hole.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150960_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I will let Kenda know the maximum limit for this tire is 12479km (7754 miles),</p><p>if they are planning to come out with even durable tire; I hope I have the chance to test it.  </p><p>This time I will have to change the whole tire set.  </p><p>The tire on the top is the brand new tire with the perfect marking on the tire; the bottom is the one that just blew.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150970_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This looks similar to the before and after of someone having a facial.</p><p> </p><p>Since I will have to change the tire, I will change everything including the frame, inner and outer tube.  </p><p>I will use the stronger tire set from Taiwan, in one look I am not sure how this new set is different from the old one.  </p><p>The completely black frame makes it look stronger with speed.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150973_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This new set of tire has already been prepared for me, and the inner tube placed inside as well.  </p><p>All I have to do is put air in it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150976-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ah, this photo shows I ride the bike with slippers!</p><p> </p><p>When changing tires there is a small thing I need to remember to remove, that is the speed meter.  </p><p>Without this I wouldn’t know how fast I am riding and how far I have rode.</p><p> </p><p>Too bad I didn’t have any tools to remove the speed meter,</p><p>I hit it with my hand several times and finally was able to remove it.  </p><p>I was really worried I would accidentally break this.  Even after I carefully removed this, </p><p>the speed meter still did not install correctly so I have to use the tape to fix it.</p><p> </p><p>Changing both the front and back tires at the same time, look at how nice it looks now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150977_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Doesn’t the black tire look cooler?</p><p> </p><p>The gear on the back wheel is brand new too.  </p><p>The brand new look makes one feel respectful, although it doesn’t look very useful.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150981_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The old chain after riding 10000km is not clutching to the new gear, even with lots of oil to grease it,</p><p>the bike still makes this clicky noise when I ride it.</p><p> </p><p>The new wheel frame doesn’t have any broken wire or frames bending, </p><p>the bike doesn’t have this unbalance-shaking feel.  </p><p>From Kazakhstan to Poland I have been shaking on the unbalance bike for several thousand km, </p><p>suddenly there is no shaking feeling I will have to get used to it.</p><p> </p><p>The new clicky noise isn’t just sound, but the tiny movement feeling passing from the pedal to the feet, </p><p>so the feet gets this weird deadening feel.  </p><p>We will see if after riding for a while the chain and the gear mix well a little better.</p><p> </p><p>Even after changing the new tires, I can’t leave the old one here since they were part of the bike.  </p><p>I retie everything on and bike toward Paris.  The bike still got four wheels.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150984-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In addition to the blown out tire, the fibers on the ends of this rope is coming apart.  </p><p>This reminds me of my shoes, my lost shoes with the ends of the shoelaces coming apart just like this rope. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150983-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had planned to arrive at the destination around 4pm, but because it took time to change to the new tires,</p><p>I didn’t stop to rest, didn’t visit any restaurants, and didn’t bother to write the travel journals either.</p><p> </p><p>Riding against the wind is really troublesome, it is always so slow, and changing to the new tire didn’t speed this up either. </p><p>I am still getting used to the clicky feel.</p><p> </p><p>Goose called around 4pm, I said I would arrive around 6pm.  At 6pm there was still 40km (25 miles) left,</p><p>so I said I would arrive around 8pm.  The arrival time is continuously moved later.</p><p> </p><p>I rode to the point the GPS was close to out of juice, the red light kept flashing, and I was still on the road.  </p><p>Normally by this time I would take out the laptop and put it in sleep mode.  </p><p>I would connect the USB wire so I can allow the GPS to charge up while I ride.</p><p> </p><p>I couldn’t do that today since the laptop doesn’t have any juice either.  </p><p>This is the result of not getting into a restaurant and write the blogs,</p><p>so the electronic items didn’t have a chance to charge up.</p><p> </p><p>If I am going to continuously ride like these, then GPS will stop recording the riding trail somewhere in the middle, </p><p>this doesn’t feel good, I will have to find a place to get things charged up.</p><p> </p><p>The help place is the bathroom inside this gas station. </p><p>Luckily there is a plug in there so I charged up in the bathroom for 5 minutes, </p><p>and then I continue riding toward Goose’s place.  </p><p>So in addition using bathroom for normal use, I can use it to charge electronic items.</p><p>While waiting for the five minutes, I washed my face and went to the gas station to buy a bottle of orange juice.  </p><p>$66Zit for four days shouldn’t be hard, this is because today is already day 4.</p><p> </p><p>We are already getting into the city center here, </p><p>but there is no sign on road to Poznana so either they didn’t put a sign up or I missed it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1150991_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Upon entering the city center, all the big streets connects together, </p><p>the freeway merges with lots of roads starting with the name A, </p><p>those streets will separate again after exiting Poznana.</p><p> </p><p>I am not afraid entering the city, but after I enter the city I will have to let Goose know where I am.  </p><p>I kept following the sign going toward the city center; the busier place the better.</p><p> </p><p>Poznana is very different from Warsaw even though both are big cities, but their feel is very different.</p><p>Warsaw was destroyed during World War II, so now it consisted of very new and elegant buildings.  </p><p>Poznana consisted of old and traditional buildings, so this town has this ancient elegant feel.</p><p> </p><p>By the time I arrived, it was 8:30pm, the sky was still bright, </p><p>and the orange sunset color allows me to browse this city in its most beautiful color.</p><p>There are beautiful carvings and pictures on the side of the building, </p><p>it is seen everywhere and elegantly done.  The whole city has lots of museums and churches, </p><p>not only they are free but they are open 24 hours.</p><p>There are electronic track cars on the street; they charge using time, 10 minute per unit.  </p><p>So when you ride them, you will have to figure out how long between each stop, </p><p>this is a pretty unique style to calculate the riding fee.  </p><p>Poland sits between Germany and Russia, so regardless who </p><p>fights whom back in the olden days they will travel through Poland, </p><p>and then destroy Poland.  Poland has already been destroyed 4 times.</p><p> </p><p>This is pretty sad to hear, one country being destroyed 4 times, </p><p>but still rebuild themselves.  Besides Polish people takes price in their own country and themselves.</p><p> </p><p>In Poznana there are lots of parks, zoo, and places to visit.  </p><p>The students here browsing around the city for a year or two still isn’t enough. </p><p>It is very lucky to come here for school.</p><p>Poznana is a college town; there are four colleges here.  </p><p>Polish people have high contribution toward developments in literature, art, and science.  </p><p>People such as Chopin, Madam Curie are all Polish.  </p><p>This is the old castle used to live by kings.  </p><p>Polish money is printed with faces of king, similar to the king you see on cards.</p><p> </p><p>This is the other side of the castle.  </p><p>Today is Friday night, on Saturdays the stores are open until 2pm in the afternoon.  </p><p>On Sundays only the big stories are open, the rest of the stores are closed, everyone goes to the church for service.</p><p>This castle is only open once a year; I am not sure what kind of elegance can be seen inside.</p><p>The double cross seen on some square, this square is made in memory of a poet.</p><p> </p><p>This is in memory of this poet named “ADAM”, too bad I am not familiar with this person.</p><p> </p><p>Next to the park is this beautiful building, the pointy building with castle like exterior.  </p><p>This is the religious service building to some school; there are lots of classical music exhibitions here.</p><p>Those photos were taken while waiting for Goose; </p><p>Goose supplements the words later on.</p><p> </p><p>Just on this street along there are lots of beautiful scenery, </p><p>Poznana is a city worth staying at for rest for a few days.</p><p> </p><p>I was waiting for Goose at the intersection of some huge street, </p><p>after 3 minutes Goose showed up with his second hand Fiat car.  </p><p> </p><p>Fiat is the common car in Poland, looking at the small car is adorable. </p><p>In addition, the gas in Poland is really expensive.  </p><p> </p><p>This is because all thinkable taxes such as pollution and fuel are all added inside the gas price.  </p><p>Besides cars also need insurance to be on the streets.</p><p>Inside is Goose with the peace sign, I am very happy to meet up with him without any problem.  </p><p> </p><p>Goose took me ahead so I slowly rode to his dorm, just short 10-minute ride.  </p><p>Today I wouldn’t have to camp anymore, I am so happy!</p><p>This is the entrance to Goose’s dorm.  For Goose’s privacy, I won’t post Goose’s picture online.</p><p>Just my luck, the dorm elevator is broken today, carrying lots of bags going all the way to the 5th floor.  </p><p>The bike is locked in the special bike room on the first floor.</p><p> </p><p>With Goose we got up to the 5th floor, this is Goose’s room; he has been to Poznana for three years.  </p><p>He knows everywhere in Poznana, he knows enough to even write a book about Poznana.  </p><p> </p><p>Looking at the development in Poznana the last few years, </p><p>it is amazing after joining the European Nation, from transportation to business development, </p><p>all are moving forward at their own rate.  Here at Goose’s dorm.</p><p>Initially just meeting Goose a few times, it was because of Apple Computers so we know each other’s username online.  </p><p>Then I was working at the Apple computer store, and one time he wanted </p><p>to take a PowerPC Power Book 17” from Taiwan to Poznana, so I used my employee discount to help him.  </p><p> </p><p>This happened back in December 2005, and it has been so long. </p><p>This time I am taking lots of baggage traveling half way across the world to Poland to meet him.  </p><p>One traveling abroad must get help from friends.</p><p>I am not sure why there is a watermelon on the floor; I am using it to put my safety helmet.</p><p> </p><p>After arriving to the dorm, I am trying to figure out how I can stay with Goose in this dorm for the next few days? </p><p>I am ok sleeping on the floor or hallway, but I don’t want to bother someone’s schedule.  </p><p>Goose already asked the Taiwanese Business Bureau here a few days </p><p>after I left Beijing if there are any dorms I can stay in for a few days.  </p><p> </p><p>Luckily there are really free dorms I can stay in, however long I would like, </p><p>as long as I don’t stay past the visa expiration date.  I left most of the luggage at Goose’s place, </p><p>just took a bag containing changing clothing before I went to the dorm.  </p><p>Here I can get hot shower and clean bed to sleep for a few days.</p><p>Poznana is so beautiful, I only used four days to ride from the boarder.  </p><p>If I push myself a little, I can make it to Germany border in one day. </p><p>It is disappointing to ride past this country in just 5 days.  </p><p> </p><p>So I decided I am going to stay in Poznana for a few days since there is kitchen here,</p><p>I can buy Ramen noodle to live on as well.  </p><p> </p><p>Please disregard when I vowed before of taking just 3 weeks riding to Paris or I will ride with only my underwear on.  </p><p>I was just saying things out loud; please don’t put it to heart.  </p><p> </p><p>There is no reason to travel so fast, there is no limit to the time staying in Poznana,</p><p>I will stay here until I am ready to leave. </p><p>In the evening Goose took me in his car to the old town to eat dinner, the night city is another look on its own.</p><p>Because it is summer, the ladies are dressed beautifully, in the winter they will cover themselves well.  </p><p>If there is chance to visit here, must come here during the summer. </p><p>In addition, Poznana is not a tourist city, there is not a lot of tourist here, but there is lots of stuff worth seeing.  </p><p>It is a good place to come visit for a month.</p><p>The cost of living here is no worry either although it is a bit higher than Europe, </p><p>but it is 4 times cheaper than the neighboring German or France.  </p><p> </p><p>The same soda in Poland is $3, the same $3 in Germany, </p><p>except here they use Polish currency Zit and in Germany they use Euros.  </p><p>The price is 4 times difference.  So one will have a great time in Poland without being poor.</p><p> </p><p>Goose asked me if I wanted to take a shower?  </p><p>Even though I am dirty right now, but I am even hungrier.  </p><p>Lets fill my stomach first, something cheap, good, and will fill me up.  </p><p>It would be better if somewhere has lots of meat, please show me the way Goose.</p><p> </p><p>Goose brought me to this restaurant, SPHINX, </p><p>this is one of the big chain store in Poland, Polish plus American fusion food.</p><p>The business is great today, the place is completely filled, it was around 9pm for dinner, there are no empty seats left.  </p><p>The waiting staffs all speak English, but Goose is able to use his smooth Polish to answer.</p><p>Polish eating style, there are three types of sauce, garlic, sweet &amp; sour, and salsa.  </p><p>You can use anything with those sauces, French fries, meat, and bread; it tastes good with anything.</p><p>The salad, tomatoes with lettuce plus a huge piece of cheese, the cheese is good, light flavor.  </p><p>It is a pleasure eating everything so cool.  </p><p>The appetizer, Goose recommended crab roll with this mushroom sauce.  </p><p>The pastry rolled with steaming crabmeat, super tasty.</p><p>Then comes the scary main meal, just one portion for both Goose and I, we are completely full.</p><p>There is a huge portion of French fries, two big portions of burgers, </p><p>grilled chicken breast, grilled beef roll, BBQ ribs, and BBQ pork chop.  </p><p>Not only you are drooling, even when I look at this picture now I am hungry all over again.</p><p> </p><p>This meal looks very American, but the Polish side is hiding underneath.  </p><p>Underneath this huge meal there is a layer picked vegetables, diakon, cabbage, and purple radish.  </p><p>Those pickled vegetables are something that is on every Polish meal. </p><p>If ordering a burger there, it will add lots of pickled vegetable, very Polish style.</p><p> </p><p>After eating this huge meal going back to the dorm for sleep.  </p><p>This weekend Goose will drive the Fiat taking me around the city.  </p><p>On Monday when school starts, it will just be me with Poznana map, another long vacation is coming. </p><p><br /></p>
