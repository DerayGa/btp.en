between camping and comfortable surroundings.  </span></p><p>After leaving MSI’s dorm in Moscow, I camped for another seven days before I reached Poland boarder.  </p><p>At the boarder I stayed in another hotel to be freshened and energized.  </p><p>After entering Poland it was another 3 days of camping.</p><p> </p><p>Lying on the bed thinking about the places I have camped, I have camped at various places.  </p><p>The nicest place I slept in was the abandoned house, the most interesting was the middle of the field, </p><p>and the worst was when I got kicked out when I was half asleep.</p><p> </p><p>There is just 2000km (1243miles) left to the trip, </p><p>it can easily be accomplished in 15 days as long as I watch for my own safety.  </p><p>Once I enter Europe, it will be toward the end of the trip.</p><p> </p><p>If someone asks me how do I feel after traveling alone for over 100 days?</p><p>The people I met on the road said all said “you crazy?” followed by unbelievable looks on their face.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at the just harvested field, nothing in sight, thinking how about camping here for the night, </p><p>but at the same time I am thinking am I crazy again? </p><p> </p><p>Drinking with drunk Belarusian, eating birdseed, even without common language we can still chitchat, </p><p>but at the same time I am thinking am I crazy? </p><p> </p><p>Camping in the middle of the night with the whole body shivering, rubbing my hands and arms against each other, </p><p>but all I felt was my goose bumps, but I am thinking am I crazy?</p><p> </p><p>Of course, no doubt, I am crazy.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at the red Gobi Desert under over 40C degrees weather, </p><p>riding in Kazakhstan with nothing in sight, </p><p>and riding in Russia freezing cold with my nose running even during the summer. </p><p> </p><p>If I didn’t ride this trip with a crazy heart, I do not know how I can cross all those places.</p><p> </p><p>There are lots of ways to live a life, </p><p>I won’t judge how other people live theirs, because this is each person’s own responsibility to themselves, </p><p>their choices to live their life. </p><p> </p><p>Rather, there are lots of people who judges me, they use their values, limitations, </p><p>religion, and their thoughts all to restrict me.  </p><p>All I can say is sorry, regardless how reasonable you are saying, even if it is rules, so what?</p><p> </p><p>After all, you are not I, </p><p>and you will not be able to understand what motives and reasons why I am doing this.</p><p> </p><p>The most important, I never live in someone’s expectations and praises, or blames and limitation, </p><p>you can call me selfish, big headed, but I don’t care how other people see me. </p><p> </p><p>This is who I am, I do what I want to do, walk the roads I want to walk, </p><p>go to places I want to go, and live the life I want to live.</p><p>I lay flat on the bed after my shower, and I kept thinking and thinking, and my thoughts went into my dream, </p><p>all the way until morning.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160093_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the morning, Goose drove taking me to get some Polish money, Zit.  </p><p>Even though Zit is only useable in Poland, but it is a good currency.  </p><p>Exchanging $100USD for Zit for me to use four days here, plus the exit fee out of Poland should be enough.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160098_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This is Goose’s Fiat, the body of the car is green but the engine top is red.  </p><p>The red top is the result from Goose’s brother, Guerilla, hit a tree on some snowy winter. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160106_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am not sure if the car fixer place is color blind, they didn’t care the color doesn’t fit, it is a car, </p><p>it is drivable, and so this is what it looks like now.</p><p> </p><p>In Poznana it is hard to find a place to exchange currency, </p><p>all the signs are Polish although inside they will exchange anything for Zit.  </p><p>Although most of their business are for eastern European countries that has not joined European Nation.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160110_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Using the exchange rate of $1USD to $2.9Zit for $100USD, on the Zit all it shows are the king’s old face, </p><p>although the coins are this pretty gold color, it looks like gold coins, I am reluctant to spend it now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160111_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Although when I entered Poland I exchanged some USD to Zit at the grocery store </p><p>they give me the exchange rate of $1USD to $2.2Zit.  </p><p>But since the exchange was made at a grocery store, all I can say is too bad I got cheated on, nothing I can do now.</p><p> </p><p>Riding in Goose’s car, there are lots of red and yellow flowers planted in the middle.  </p><p>Although the flowers are blooming very pretty right now, </p><p>but when winter comes with the snow the temperature is negative degrees, all those flowers freeze to death.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160114_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When it comes to spring, Poznana will dig up all the dead flowers and replant them.  </p><p>This is to beautify the city, so they do this every year.</p><p> </p><p>Some street in Poznana, the Sphinx on the left is where we had dinner last night. </p><p>As you can see beautiful girls are everywhere, but in the winter the girls are covered up.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160116_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>People in Poland follow the law, the cars on the road have the smallest rights; </p><p>the first is the pedestrians, then the electric cars and bus, the last are private cars.</p><p> </p><p>Cars running on the street must follow all signals, this include the lights, the signs,</p><p>there is no horn sound heard on the road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160124_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Other than driving, people also follow rules in parking.  Underneath the sign,</p><p>there will be markings showing how cars should be parked, straight or horizontal, </p><p>or half way in and half way on the street, no detail left behind.</p><p> </p><p>The sign on the right side of the photo says the cars here all have to park </p><p>on the street inside the gray lines and has to be tilted, and here is free parking.</p><p> </p><p>This is Poznana’s business trade exhibition center, but this is just the entrance.  </p><p>Inside the space is huge, and there are several buildings as well; just looking at the door of this place is already amazing. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160122_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Before returning to the dorm, lets eat a meal of the traditional breakfast here.  </p><p>The purple vegetable and pickled vegetable is the norm here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160131_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is traditional Polish sweet bun; the outside of the soft bread will be covered with chocolate or syrup, </p><p>inside it will also have jam or butter.  The flavor is great and the price is cheap as well. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160134_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is traditional Polish coffee, this is does not smell like coffee brewed by a machine.  </p><p>Rather this is made by ground the coffee beans then add hot water without stirring and presented to the customers.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160136_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Before drinking, one must be careful of stirring well, and then wait a few minutes to let the coffee powder dissolve, </p><p>this tastes is very different from traditional coffee.</p><p>After drinking all of the liquid, you notice the undissolved coffee powder on the bottom of the cup.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160143_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For breakfast just simple orders of French fries, scrambled eggs with sliced sausages.  </p><p>These are good but simple food with a big slice of bread, this takes care of the lunch as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160139_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160141_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Map of Poznana, this one is posted on the wall, but I got myself a personal map that includes suburb area of Poznana.  </p><p>Poznana is a big city.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160149_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While at Goose’s dorm this morning I used high speed Internet.  </p><p>The dorm I am staying in has Internet problem so I couldn’t get online.  </p><p>So for the next few days I will have to go to Goose’s dorm to use the Internet. </p><p> </p><p>In the afternoon I went to the old town to browse around, </p><p>that is Poznana’s oldest city and also the most popular city center.</p><p> </p><p>Even though it is just the end of August, </p><p>but a lot of trees in the street already turned autumn colors.</p><p> </p><p>In winter at Poznana, the sun doesn’t come up until 8:30am, and it gets dark around 4pm.  </p><p>The sight from then is totally different from now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160150_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The dated buildings are usually built with red bricks and red tile for roof;</p><p>it is hard to guess what those buildings are used for.</p><p> </p><p>For example, these red buildings are the largest obstetrics and gynecology hospital in Europe, </p><p>each year they deliver over 6000 babies. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160155_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Other than being a university town in Poznana, it is also the largest medical center in Poland,</p><p>it occupies important medical field.</p><p> </p><p>Another street, the tracks on the street and the electrical lines on the top are for electrical cars.  </p><p>If the cross walks doesn’t have traffic signals, </p><p>then the pedestrians always have the right of way.</p><p> </p><p>Even if there is traffic signal installed, only need to push this button </p><p>and in a few seconds the light will change for pedestrian right of way.</p><p>Cars driving on the road have 24 lights on policy, in the suburbs the speed limit is 70km, it is even slower in the city.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160161_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>All the buildings on the street have their own personal taste, there are beautiful balcony and carvings seen everywhere.  </p><p>Even with just browsing on the street with no destination in mind, this is a wonderful city to tour around in.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160163_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>If lucky, one can even see hot air balloon with ads on them flying by, </p><p>in this day and age be able to see one of those is very rare.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160167_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The weather is good here on the weekend, there was thunderstorm on Thursday, and it was cloudy on Friday.  </p><p>But the weather is cooperating; when I reached Poznana it is sunny, letting me to view the best possible.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160172_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The road with tracks on it, the cars can drive on it as well.  </p><p>On the older roads they are not paved asphalt roads but stone paved. </p><p>When cars drive by the road shakes, </p><p>one has to be careful biting their tongue when walking and driving on stone covered road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160174_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The police are not all over the streets either, if it is just small mistake, </p><p>for example like crossing the cross walk and did not get off to walk the bike,</p><p>and if the person didn’t know and made this mistake, the police will let this time slide.</p><p> </p><p>Parking the car next to the national museum, there are random exhibitions.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160181_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The carving next to the front door, those things are very lucky to escape being destroyed by the war.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160186_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The mosaics on the sidewall of the museum.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160178_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The huge painting on the backside of the museum.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160195_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Each painting should be a story, for anyone who is interested can look for the story himself or herself.  </p><p>For people who want can travel to Poland themselves, the reward will be even better.</p><p> </p><p>This is mentioned before, the area to play soccer is even shown with a picture, and a hilarious picture is shown.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160191_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Behind the red bricks with the wall covered in stones is the old wall, inside the wall is the old city,</p><p>but it isn’t old at all; inside is full of life, beautiful, elegant, and full of culture.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160198_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The main city center of the old town is a square in shape; it does not allow any car, not even bicycles.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160293_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160223_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Beautiful girls is seen everywhere, even beautiful mothers, the least likely seen here are tourist.  </p><p>If you have a chance to visit here, you might be the only tourist here.  </p><p>I will post the front pictures of the beautiful girls later.</p><p> </p><p>There is outdoors dining available at the square as well; they are all decorated well. </p><p>A lot of college students work here, English is acceptable here. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160206_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are at least four fountains like this one on the square.  </p><p>This one is holding a three-pronged trident so he should be Poseidon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160211_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the background there is a building with green pointy top, </p><p>it is Poznana City Hall, it is sitting right in the middle of the whole square.</p><p> </p><p>All the carving here, each is carved just like it is alive; this looks like a human frozen in time.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160291_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160345_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1512" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The houses surrounding the square all have distinct characters; </p><p>the exterior, color, and style are all different.  </p><p>They are all very colorful but not shocking.  </p><p>The outdoor dining areas on the square mix in well do not destroy the look of the square.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160220_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160269_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160232_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The tallest one is the city office; it looks like a mixture of a church and a castle.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160242_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ancient buildings and carvings are seen everywhere, and they are free for browsing.  </p><p>They aren’t afraid for you to look, just afraid that you do not have time to see it all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160227_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1776" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This is the street outside of the square, this is the center of the city center, </p><p>and the whole Poznana is developed from this point outward.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160229-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even the washing sink at the square seems older than the people here,</p><p>pushing on the bronze knob, cold water will come out of the monster’s mouth.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160235-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dirty water will exit in the sewer water; I am not sure in this ancient city how the sewer system is designed.</p><p> </p><p>There are very few vendors selling postcards, flags, pinwheels, toys, clothing, and displays, just 2 or 3 of them.  </p><p>This is another sign of very few tourists around.</p><p>The scary Teletubbies is here as well.</p><p>The strange plastic toys, after looking at what is sold at flea market,</p><p>the stuff is very normal compared to the things sold at the flea market.</p><p>All the postcards seen below are views of Poznana.  </p><p>From the postcards everywhere seem very beautiful;</p><p>I am not sure in these few days if I have time to view all those places.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160352-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Painting area, these are all real painting, not copied works.  It depends on your own view if it is good or bad.</p><p> </p><p>There is art school in Poznana as well, not far from city center there is an art building with items that has useful art pieces.  </p><p>This means the art pieces are not just for display but rather for use as well.</p><p>For example, this chair shaped like a horn, the building behind is the music instruments museum.</p><p> </p><p>This is another way to use art, in the square the chairs are all weird shapes, </p><p>some doesn’t even look like chairs, but everyone sits there happily.</p><p>Walking halfway across the square you will see City Hall building.  </p><p>There is painting and carving all over the wall.</p><p>The carriage walking around the square, there is a feeling of time going backwards to Renaissance time.</p><p> </p><p>The fountain in front of the city hall, the carving is actually made out of stone, </p><p>so this one wouldn’t oxidize and turn green.</p><p> </p><p>The Poznana’s city sign is two goats’ head against each other, just like the picture in front of this store.  </p><p>There are lots of carving and pictures made based off this picture seen everywhere in the city.</p><p> </p><p>In front of this restaurant the dried floral wreath is beautiful, just like what is shown on the picture.  </p><p>The chef’s recommendation meal here is Cornish Game Hen.</p><p> </p><p>The bar.  In Poznana the streets are named after famous people so the street name are usually really long.  </p><p>Thus the street names are abbreviated to fit in the street sign.</p><p>Some bookstore building, this is Poznana’s city planner; he is very good to plan Poznana to be the way it is today.</p><p> </p><p>The below sign says “STARY RYNEK” which means “old market”.  </p><p>This sign is seen everywhere in the four corners of the square.  </p><p>All the buildings in the square all use this name, STARY RYNEK, as an address.</p><p> </p><p>The 89/90 sign on the door is the home number, some homes will even has gas pipe number shown as well, </p><p>this is in case if something happens, the gas company will know which gas pipe they need to deal with.</p><p>Another street connected to the square, the car is only able to drive this far.</p><p>Since we are on the topic of cars, lets mention about Polish drivers.  </p><p>The cars with an L sign on the top are all new drivers. </p><p>Regardless how badly those new drivers drive, even mistakes that makes the road backs up, </p><p>there won’t be anyone honking at them.</p><p> </p><p>Even though the L sign makes the car looks idiotic, but the trade off is the enormous courtesy from other drivers.</p><p>This is the parking meter.</p><p> </p><p>When you park somewhere that requires pay, prepay for a ticket and then leave it on the car windshield, </p><p>otherwise the fine is really high for no pay parking ticket.  </p><p> </p><p>There are price differences for parking depending on where, the red area is the most expensive,</p><p>the green is the cheapest, and the same goes the longer you park the more expensive it is.</p><p> </p><p>For example parking for 10 minutes is $10, but if continuously parking for 20 minutes it might be $30, </p><p>and if parking for total 30 minutes might be $100.</p><p> </p><p>The reason for this is for the drivers not to occupy one spot for too long, or don’t even driver the car out.</p><p> </p><p>This is in contrast to public transportation, the longer you use it, and the cheaper it is. </p><p>The reasoning is having everyone using public transportation.</p><p> </p><p>Walking outside of the alley way will see a whole brick wall still in perfect condition.</p><p>Inside this wall is art museum; I bet a lot of the art pieces on the square are from them.</p><p> </p><p>There are also history majors, so other than studying at school, </p><p>the students also responsible for maintaining the church in this city.  </p><p>Not only is this putting what you learned into use, but also fusing the people and the city together, </p><p>so the city will always be part of people’s lives.</p><p> </p><p>This is also a Fiat, but it is locked up due to having tickets.</p><p>For cars with unpaid ticket, the cops will just lock them up on the street.  </p><p>The driver can call the police station from the number shown on the lock, then someone will come and hand you a ticket.  </p><p>You must pay the ticket right there, and then they will unlock the lock for you.</p><p> </p><p>There is lots of street lightening, the whole neighborhood is the same design, </p><p>and so in the evening the lights will give the city another look.</p><p>For the bigger buildings, such as City Hall, church, or castle, there are designated lights for the evening.  </p><p>This makes the city safer even at night.</p><p> </p><p>This sign designate this is use for bicycles only.  </p><p>Riding on uneven road like this, the bones in the whole body will shake to pieces.</p><p> </p><p>In Poznana tourist center, Goose got me a copy of Poznana map and main attractions, </p><p>so now I can tour around the city on my own with the map.</p><p>Of course those are all free, in Europe as long as the sign has “i” on it,</p><p>it is designed for information, all the pamphlets are for taking.  </p><p> </p><p>Getting tired after the walk, so stopping at the sidewalk café to rest;</p><p>all the sidewalk cafes have great business, almost everyplace is filled.  </p><p>The decoration isn’t cheap either; it feels like sitting in a garden.</p><p>This is live band, performing around the sidewalk café.  </p><p>Pleasing music flows through the whole square, with the addition of the church bells ringing at times,</p><p>the view, sound, and smell are all in enjoyment.</p><p>The very tiny coffee just a little bit bigger than the thumb, filled 1/3 full, looks like someone has drunk it already.  </p><p>But this is regular sized condensed coffee.</p><p>If you want water, order coffee first.  The restaurants here, </p><p>or European restaurants, water cost money, and might not be cheaper than beverage drinks.</p><p> </p><p>This is what I ordered, extra fancy peach ice cream, and there are two sticks of cookies sticking out.</p><p> </p><p>After eating snack, we continue to browse around.  </p><p>There is no need to talk about windows without ugly metal bars, </p><p>the beautiful red flowers grown all over the balcony is extremely pretty.</p><p> </p><p>Walking away from the square, in somewhere you will see this bicycle statue, postcards and tour guides all have him on it.</p><p>However, this famous statue isn’t a real person.  </p><p>Back in time this is a character from a newspaper story, everyone knows him.  </p><p>Maybe the statue I saw in Moscow of the grandpa on bicycle might have a story behind him as well.</p><p> </p><p>Inserting a beautiful girl picture, Polish girls are known to be the most beautiful girls in Europe; </p><p>they have excellent exterior, good character, beautiful with lots of energy, and friendly as well.</p><p>On the streets you will see lots of girls having weird hairstyles like you saw in magazines, </p><p>they will also wear weird clothing; Polish girls aren’t far away from what is hot in fashion.  </p><p> </p><p>Seeing so many beautiful girls, other than being surprised, there is no time for pictures.  </p><p>Please go to Poznana yourself if you like to see beautiful girls.  </p><p> </p><p>Streets in Poznana, the longer I see it the better it is.</p><p> </p><p>Eating dinner at this restaurant, the most famous dish is their salad; the sign says Green Balcony</p><p>It is hard to eat fresh produce during the trip, most of the time just juice.  </p><p>When I see fresh produce I will buy some to eat. </p><p>When Goose brought other people here to eat their reaction was “coming here is like eating grass” </p><p>so I ask Goose bringing me here to eat a good grass meal.</p><p> </p><p>The restaurant has lots of small bees hanging for decoration, each year the decoration changes; last year was sheep.</p><p>The restaurant has good vibe to it, and the meal isn’t so shockingly expensive either.  </p><p>This is similar to what you get in Europe, but the price is just 1/4 of what you would normally pay in Europe.  </p><p>I plan to come to Poland in the future and take my time around to see everything.</p><p>The lamps on the table are pretty, and the smell of tasty food flowing around, </p><p>I am hungry, bring the menu fast so we can order.</p><p>The waitress is a beautiful girl, she happens to be the girl friend of Goose’s classmate.  </p><p>Too bad she is taken already, so regardless how good a friend anyone is at this point, </p><p>all I can say they are monster taking the beautiful girls.</p><p>The full and thick menu is written by hand, it is not I don’t understand Russian or Polish; </p><p>even looking at English menus confuses me.</p><p>Even though the price here is cheaper than the rest of Europe, but Pozana’s cost of living rises every year as well.  </p><p>The same salad with pricing on the right side originally being $23Zit ($8.36USD) is now $25Zit ($9USD); </p><p>the same goes for originally $27Zit ($9.81USD) is now $30Zit ($10USD).</p><p> </p><p>After ordering just waiting for my good meal.  The drinks came first; </p><p>this is cold red tea with the addition of watermelon balls.  </p><p>The large sized cold tea with watermelons I can eat, I recommend this.</p><p> </p><p>With Goose we are sharing a big plate of salad, the portion here is amazingly large, </p><p>anyone who can finish his or her meal alone should be applauded.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the basket there are utensils, condiments, butter, bread, and a bottle of sweet and sour salad dressing.</p><p> </p><p>The delicious salad is here, it is too big and there are lots of goods underneath, one photo cannot fit it all.  </p><p>For people who are just looking but can’t eat it, just restrain yourself for this section.</p><p>On the very top of the salad are grilled chickens; on the bottom there are lettuce, </p><p>grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, spouts, and some dried fruit.  </p><p>The salad has honey sauce on it, taking a little of everything.  </p><p>Each plate looks and tastes delicious, if you say this is like eating grass is not giving it enough credit.</p><p> </p><p>For people who are hungry and looking at the wonderful meal above probably already run away for help;</p><p>after eating a wonderful meal, on the way home saw this ad prompting this famous artist named Mucha.  </p><p>He was born in the former Austrian empire, but is Czechoslovakian. </p><p>His painting style is like the poster, the people in the painting are realistic style, </p><p>and the clothing and background uses beautiful styles with flowers and grass for decoration.</p><p>The time I am at Poznana happens to be the same time for his art show, </p><p>I will find some time to go see his painting exhibition, continuously eating good food will deplete me of art cells.</p><p> </p><p>Before going back to the dorm we climbed to this dorm which happens to be the oldest and the tallest one.  </p><p>They were able to build something this tall 20-30 years ago;</p><p>the exterior looks like a jail cell with thick carving feel.</p><p>The dorm is very old; everything inside is old including the elevator.  </p><p>The door to the elevator is a knob, the same way as opening a door by pulling out;</p><p>it is hard to see this is an elevator from the outside.</p><p> </p><p>The architecture inside the dorm is old, although we are not sure the condition inside the rooms itself.  </p><p>It has been so old; it must be interesting if living in there.  </p><p> </p><p>Looking at Poznana at the very top of the building, the planning of this green city is amazing.  </p><p>Other than the red roof tops, everything else is covered with green trees.</p><p>This is the first day touring in Poznana, staying in this city for a while, not in a hurry to leave at all.</p></div>
