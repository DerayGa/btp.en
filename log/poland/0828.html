T_T</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160931_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Three Cup Chicken and Curry are great; the meal also supplemented my lack of vegetables from previous meals.  </p><p>If you have friends who are Indian, then they would look down upon you for using curry seasoning cubs to make curry. </p><p>It doesn’t matter as long as the flavor is great.  </p><p> </p><p>The weather wasn’t good that night, dark clouds were very low and dark.  </p><p>The cold breeze at night makes the temperature keep going down.  </p><p>Does this mean the few good weather days will end?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160924_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After I got up, it was still blue skies.  Good thing it didn’t rain or I would stay in the dorm for another day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160942_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I turn on the computer and started typing on the keyboard,</p><p>looking at the bright sunlight with white clouds outside makes me want to find an alligator to fight. </p><p>If I win, then I wouldn’t need to write the travel diaries anymore. </p><p> </p><p>A little past three Goose came back from his class. </p><p>He opened the door and saw me still in the dorm and said “Wow, are you a dorm dwelling male?”  </p><p> </p><p>Actually, it isn’t terrible being a dorm dweller.  </p><p>However with the nice weather today, and I just finished the travel diaries,</p><p>I can finally go out joy riding the bike with no destination in mind.  </p><p> </p><p>Today I want to prove that I wasn’t talking out of air about Poznana’s beautiful girls.  </p><p>The below photos are taken within an hour.  </p><p>I have also included the photos Goose took of the beautiful girls on street.  </p><p>People who want to look ahead and skipping useless talks can do so.  </p><p> </p><p>Those photos do not need words to describe.  </p><p>From this photo you can see the yellow pedestrian walking button on the traffic light.  </p><p>A few seconds after pressing the button, the light will change to green. </p><p>The pedestrians follow the traffic signal and walk on the pedestrian walk way. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160946_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="613" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>MPK is the abbreviation for Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacyjne, the city’s public transportation office.  </p><p>Here it sells the tickets for cable cars and buses.  </p><p>The stores on the street also sell tickets, but the MPK office do a bit more such as adding value to the monthly pass.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160947_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the final stop for the cable car.  </p><p>Poznana’s cable car is very long but not as wide so it doesn’t give the fatness feeling.  </p><p>The entrance hangs a sign says [Solid Security], the security company.  </p><p>When I was camping at Warsaw, twice this security company asked me to leave.  </p><p>This means they take their jobs seriously.  Even though that is annoying but it also means they are trustworthy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160950_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This is the little frog convenience store seen all over Poznana.  </p><p>Shopping here means picking out what you want yourself and pay at the counter. </p><p>This isn’t like Russia’s conservative shopping style. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160951_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The weather is extremely great.  The roads used by cars, cable car, and bikes all have marked out on the street. </p><p>Everyone uses the roads they are suppose to take as long as there is a sign indicating </p><p>on where each is suppose to go, or else a ticket soon follows.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160954_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If there is no sign for bike path, in theory it means the whole city is bike friendly.  </p><p>However, when crossing the street I must get off the bike and walk the bike, or else a ticket follows.  </p><p> </p><p>The cable car has large windows for viewing.  </p><p>Sitting in it allows viewing of the whole city.  I constantly see girls handing out advertisements on the street</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160957_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="624" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Cable cars have different colors although yellow with green ones are most common.  </p><p>This blue cable car is also pretty. </p><p>The street lights all have been designed which makes any photos on the street a beautiful postcard.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160958_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is Poznana’s tradition; the streets are named after famous people.  </p><p>The street names uses whole names so each street name is very long.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160963_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Underneath the street sign there will also be photo and biography of the person, </p><p>explaining what the person did for Poznana.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160980_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This is the poet Adam Mickiewicz’s memorial park.  </p><p>The fountain is beautiful with lots of people lying on green grass sunning on it.  </p><p>There is a big building right across from the fountain. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160969_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the national theater which shows cases first class opera performance with cheap tickets. </p><p>This allows the public to experience art without having to pay a lot.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160973_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The best seat of the house is close enough to smell the perfume </p><p>on the performer with one ticket less than $600 NT (~$19 USD).  </p><p>At this price in Taiwan, the only available seat is the one requiring a binocular to see the small people on the stage.  </p><p>The cheapest ticket here is about the same as buying a bottle of soda.  </p><p>Most of the operas are performed in Italian with Polish subtitles. </p><p>If there is a chance to visit inside, then it is also an experience.  </p><p> </p><p>This is the traditional yellow with green cable car.  I have only ridden the bus but not the cable car yet.  </p><p>Other than the fact that the cable car drives on the tracks, all the traffic rules apply as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160975_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>All sort of architecture is seen, not only is there red bricks with green roof, all styles of building are seen in Poznana.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160976_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Today there is a red bus with a yellow cross sign on it parked in front of Adam Mickiewicz’s statue.  </p><p>The bus also has hospital writings on it.  This looks like a mobile blood donation bus.  </p><p>The background is a castle, maybe a past king lives here.  </p><p>There are lots of Mucha’s posters all over the city; there is also a Mucha poster on the castle.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170001_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went over to the blood donation bus and asked if foreigners can donate blood as well?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160995_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>However, neither of those 2 girls are staff but pretty girls who are donating their own blood as well.  </p><p>They told me foreigners should be able to donate blood but the forms are in Polish. </p><p>I would need to find someone who can translate the form for me so I can fill the form out.  </p><p>This is too bad because if the 2 girls are nurses and asking for blood donation, </p><p>80% of the guys would be willing to donate all their blood.</p><p> </p><p>This building is next to the castle, which is the building hosting Mucha’s art exhibition.  </p><p>The art exhibition lasts until November for this Czechoslovakia artist.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170041_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Based off this poster, Mucha’s art is a danger to Lolita Complex.</p><p> </p><p>It is very common to see beautiful girl walking a big dog.  </p><p>However, I only saw a little girl walking a strange dog today.  </p><p>There are a lot of dogs here but very few dog poops on the street.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170004_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Some square in the city.  The surrounding buildings are the main branch offices of big banks.  </p><p>The building closest is the largest chain book store in Poznana.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170013_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Most of the streets name signs hang on the side of the building.  </p><p>The signs on the streets are signs telling distance to a destination or a particular location.  </p><p>Different locations use different sign colors.  The type of signs for Movie Theater and monastery are different.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170030_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are lots of pigeons in Poznana.  </p><p>Other than people feeding them bread, there are also places that have food and water for the pigeons. </p><p>All the pigeons are well feed and not afraid of people. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170036_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The islands separating the streets are planted with alternating red and yellow flowers.  </p><p>The flowers are beautiful and bloom for a long time, all the way until snow falls.  </p><p>The flowers are replanted again during the following spring.  </p><p> </p><p>This is another student passing out advertisement.  </p><p>Most of the Poznana female students wear a cap and pony tail, and carrying backpack and earphone. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170042_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This building next to Adam Mickiewicz’s statue, covered with greeneries, is the auditorium to a university.  </p><p>There is symphony band inside, so there must be high quality performance for people to enjoy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170051_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the entrance to the art college. </p><p>If the entrance has a sign in white words with red background, </p><p>it means the building is a government office or an important building.  </p><p>Those signs also mean the building is available for the public to visit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170053_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Another view of greeneries.  Poznana is a beautifully planned city with lots of greeneries; the air quality is also great.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170055_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is a taxi on the right side.  BMW isn’t that unusual here; lots of BMW are used as taxis in Poznana.  </p><p>A Fiat is more popular, and very cute a swell. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170057_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The darker skin is like a burnt wheat color, even though she is also a citizen of Poznana.  </p><p>Poznana doesn’t have beaches but there are lots of indoor tanning salons.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170059_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="587" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Regardless how beautiful the girls are, they aren’t edible.  </p><p>I ate a nice dinner in a famous restaurant in the suburbs opened in 1937. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170070_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The decoration inside the restaurant is clean and well lit.  </p><p>There is even a large yellow duck toy on display.  The chef’s recommendation here is apple and duck.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170074_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Most of the people come here order apple and duck.  The price isn’t cheap, 100g (0.22 lbs) cost $8 Zlit.  </p><p>Half of a duck is about 500g (1.10 lb), which is $40 Zlit ($14.6 USD); </p><p>adding on $7 Zlit ($2.54 USD) worth of appetizer, drink, and soup.  It cost about $700 NT ($22 USD) per person.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170081_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The first dish is duck blood soup.  A special technique is used so the duck blood doesn’t solidify </p><p>with the addition of duck gizzard and noodle dumplings.  The flavor is like any other Polish dish, salty.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170090_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The main dish, apple and duck, half duck grilled to perfection.  </p><p>The skin is crispy with tender duck meat and the addition of sweet grilled apples.  </p><p>On the sides are some fresh vegetables and 2 bread buns.  Polish people also like bread buns.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170096_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Half of a duck is perfect for one person.  If I eat a whole duck, I would be too full. </p><p> If girls come, they would only need 1/4 of a duck.  </p><p> </p><p>On the way back to the dorm I got some ice cream from the store as dessert.  </p><p>The store also sells vegetables.  The cheapest vegetables are potatoes; 1kg of potatoes is less than $1 Zlit ($0.36 USD). </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170097_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Taiwan has lot of potatoes that are shipped from Poland and then processed in Taiwan; </p><p>this means lot of people has eaten potatoes from Poland.</p><p> </p><p>This is the processed meat section in the frozen section.  It is rare to see beef in Poland.  </p><p>The beef meat is skinny and expensive.  For 1kg (2.2 lbs) of beef it sells for $500 NT ($15 USD). </p><p>Instead there are lots of processed pork and chicken such as sausages, salted meat, and ham.  </p><p>There is the bread bun on the top left, which only needs to be heated a bit to be edible.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170111_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is getting close to the Chinese Moon Festival; the moon in the sky is very bright and round.  </p><p>The night in Poznana is different.  For people who prefer night time stores can also find night time activities in Poznana.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170114_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>After my meal and ice cream, Gorilla is prepared to change the chain on the bike.  </p><p>I took out the spare chain brought from Taiwan, so I am ready to solve the chain problem once for all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170119_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Taking off the old chain first.  When I changed to the new tires previously, I added lots of lubricating oil.  </p><p>This combined with the dust from the ride, the bike is very dirty. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170124_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am prepared to bring the old chain that just got taken off back to Taiwan.  </p><p>This is much easier to carry than the old tires.  Then the new chain, which RST helped to obtain, is added onto the bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170125_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because of my bike repairing skill, the new chain is snap on type which takes 3 seconds to do.  </p><p>After that it takes about 30 minutes to adjust the speed change on the bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170129_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This section is for Gorilla to do. </p><p>The adjustment is made so there isn’t no strange sound when speed changes, and the chain won’t fall off the tooth on the bike.  </p><p>This does take someone with skills to do.  Once the speed adjustment is done, I took the bike downstairs for a test ride.  </p><p>This is a wonderful change from the past; there is no more of strange sound and vibration.  </p><p>This means the rest of the ride to Paris will be a lot easier, </p><p>and there is no need to change the chain for the riding trip around Taiwan in the future.</p><p> </p><p>== Below are Goose’s take on beautiful girls on the street. == </p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1070654_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1200" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1070713_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1200" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1070738_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1080390_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1200" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1080406_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1200" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1080494_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1080527_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1080790_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/l1080800_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1330" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><br /></p>
