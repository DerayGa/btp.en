										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-130_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Today is Sunday, the second rest day in Poznana.  </span></p><p>In my original plan, I had planned to leave Poznana tomorrow.  </p><p>However, the plan has changed, this city is worth to be walked around, I am in no hurry to leave.  </p><p>Thus this has become one of the days I am in Poznana.</p><p> </p><p>Poznana is a quiet city anyway, and on Sunday it is even quieter.  </p><p>There is only the church bell heard on the street since everyone has gone to the Sunday church service.  </p><p>In this city with lots of churches around, </p><p>I randomly picked a church near the old city to observe the Sunday service.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160438_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This church looks very simple outside, but it is breath taking beautiful inside.  </p><p>The place is filled with people coming for the Sunday service, and all the seats are gone.  </p><p>The people that are just entering will have to stand for the service.</p><p> </p><p>There is a little boy dressed in black sitting on a stool by the front entrance reading a book.  </p><p>His clothing are clean and elegant, it is hard to imagine he is actually a beggar.  </p><p>The beggar in Poznana has high class.  They stand quietly on the street side, and most are clean.  </p><p>They look like they are waiting for someone; the only difference is he has a collection box next to him on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Some will ask you if you have any spare change?  Any cigarettes?  </p><p>If the answer is no, they won’t bother you, just smile and leave.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first view after entering the church.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160440_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are lots of religious people; the ceiling inside the church is at least 5 stories high.  </p><p>The prayer from the priest and the elegant music mix together well.  </p><p>Even though I am not religious, I can feel the respectful feeling.  </p><p>This makes me feel I become a tiny person and this sermon language surpass any human power.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160457_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The painting on the ceiling is very pretty, and the design in the whole place is very exquisite.  </p><p>This type of church is spread through out if the city, and lots of them are open 24 hours a day.  </p><p>So when anyone needs to be comfortered, they can enter a church anytime.  </p><p>It is fine taking pictures, as long as there is no flash.  Don’t let one’s silly mistake become an international joke.</p><p> </p><p>I am going to the flea market this morning.  </p><p>Anywhere with cross walk there is this button you can push, after pressing a few seconds, </p><p>the light becomes green for people to walk across the street.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160462_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The trees on the street grown so big, they probably didn’t’ expect it would grow so big when they first planted it.  </p><p>Therefore, the stone walkway rises from the tree’s roots.  </p><p>In late August, it is already turning into autumn with leaves flying everywhere.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160466_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The location of the flea market is at the abandoned mill with the big chimney.  </p><p>The flea market is only open on Sundays.  </p><p>Today most of the stores are closed, so I came here to see another way of selling goods.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160468_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Walking around the outside wall of the abandoned mill, the place inside is filled with people visiting the flea market; </p><p>this place has everything strange available for sale.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160470_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The left side hanging with a yellow banner says flea market.  </p><p>There is a biker parking his bike.  Chances are, the bike will be gone in a few minutes.  </p><p>The bike theft is very high in Poznana regardless if it is a cheap bike or if one that is locked.  </p><p>As long as the bike is away from eyesight, the bike will be gone fast.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first booth with items for sale as soon as I entered the flea market; </p><p>there are old clothing, painting, and some old frames on the table.  </p><p>I can’t believe people will even sell this type of things.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160473_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Actually, these items are decent quality since some of the booths are selling items that are close to trash quality, </p><p>and the price are extremely cheap.  Rather than saying these are goods, </p><p>this is more like taking useless items from the dark corners of the home to sell, </p><p>putting everything under the sun and see who is willing to pay some money to take them home.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160482_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Before browsing I am getting some delicious food to feed myself.  </p><p>There are very few food booths in the flea market; this BBQ booth is one of them. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160476_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is gigantic sized sausage and extremely thick pork pieces to select from.  </p><p>The pricing is cheap considering the amount you will be getting.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160480_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>With the addition of ketchup and yellow mustard plus a huge piece of bread, </p><p>I will die happy as long as I can be here eating a huge piece of sausage and BBQ pork.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160487_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The flea market sells everything strange here, </p><p>after looking around for a while I feel there is nothing that can’t be sold here, nothing is weird here.  </p><p>There are lots of items here; I will just use simple description below.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160474_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The metal items here are corroded; the silver items also are not shiny anymore.  </p><p>As long as anyone is willing to pay and take some time to take care of the items,</p><p>things that don’t look like much will have a brand new look.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160493_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The item below is a corroded ax and a knife for cutting.  </p><p>One can easily cut spices using this with some light pressure applied. </p><p> </p><p>This open booth selling technology items is very advanced already; </p><p>there are ancient cell phones, CRT monitors, and the first generation Play Station.  Oh the memories! </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160498_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is no price on any of the items at flea market, it all depends on what the seller tell you, </p><p>and then you can bargain with them.  There is lots of room for bargaining.  </p><p>Buying items here with bargaining is also a fun feeling.  </p><p> </p><p>Although Polish language is required.</p><p> </p><p>In Warsaw, lots of young people can speak English, </p><p>and very well, but the older people in Poznana can only speak German,Russian, Spanish, and Polish.  </p><p>English is the only language they are not able to understand. </p><p> </p><p>This is the same for people flying into Poland.  </p><p>At customs, the people who don’t speak Polish the immigration officer is more troublesome, </p><p>maybe not a little, but a lot troublesome.</p><p> </p><p>I had originally thought since I was entering from Belarus into Poland </p><p>with my Taiwan passport the customs was being difficult to me.  </p><p> </p><p>However, I found out even people taking international flight doesn’t have an easy time either.  </p><p>Even though everyone has exited already, but the immigration officers grill people from Taiwan.  </p><p>It is very common here, the same at Russia, regardless if traveling by self or traveling with a group. </p><p> </p><p>So many bikes, and the prices are very cheap, although the chances of getting stolen bikes are pretty high.  </p><p>Guerilla already got 4 bikes stolen in Poznana.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160499_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The very ancient rifle, guns, sword, they are all real items, although one will need to find bullets to fire the items.  </p><p>These items are probably 50 years or older, they can easily be displayed at any museums.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160501_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>A very big duck toy placed in the middle of a cart at the flea market.  </p><p>This looks like a lucky toy, if I have money I can buy it, </p><p>and the next time when I come to the flea market again the lucky toy will become another one.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160503_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This is filled with people, complimented with a nice sunny day.  This is the perfect activity after Sunday service.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160504_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The mealtime here isn’t three times a day.  </p><p>They start their breakfast at 8am, followed by 10am snack with the lunch at 3pm.  </p><p>Finally, right before bedtime with dinner at 10pm.</p><p> </p><p>There are four meals a day, and each meal is different.  </p><p>Some are just cold bread, although the afternoon lunch meal is the most important meal for the day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160507_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The booth selling shoes, this booth is nice in the way that they will put two shoes of the same next to each other.  </p><p>The other booths all have shoes in a big pile.  It would require luck to find two of the same shoes. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160512_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was tempted to buy this alligator slipper, too bad my feet is so big, </p><p>I will continue to wear my blue and white slippers.</p><p> </p><p>They even sell the blue bear cookie tin, everything on the table is $2Zit ($0.9USD) each, approximately $25NT.  </p><p>There are no organization to what is placed on the table, it is similar to garage sale.  </p><p>If there is organization to the goods, then it is more like second hand store. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160516_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This booth is selling clothing, they are more elegant than some of other booth, </p><p>and they are displaying it hanging off a Fiat. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160520_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The guy of this booth asked me if I am willing to trade their ZENIT film camera for the LX2 digital camera I am holding.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160530_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Trading one for one, I wouldn’t need to pay anything extra!</p><p> </p><p>This sounds like a good trade; of course this means good business for the guy.  </p><p>The ancient camera looks good, but I said no.  The guy then kept adding to the trade.  </p><p>It ended up being one huge video camera, a ZENIT film camera, </p><p>an ancient radio, plus a strange championship cup for the trade.  </p><p> </p><p>Polish people are very interesting, of course I still said no to the trade.  </p><p>This is because I would need to buy lots of films for the rest of the trip photos.</p><p> </p><p>Flea market style selling, some of the booth selling watches that are extremely cheap,</p><p>but the watch are all out of battery.  </p><p>After purchasing the watch, one will need to purchase battery for it, </p><p>and the cost of the battery is more than the watch itself.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160532_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>People with time in the morning can definitely get neat items for cheap price.  </p><p>However, the things may not be useful, maybe one day wake up and wonder why did I buy all those things originally?</p><p> </p><p>However, the feeling of finding treasure and browsing around in the middle of bargaining, is an amazing happy feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Booth selling old books, comics, magazines, and CDs.  </p><p>There are lots of bookstores in Poland.  The number of bookstores in a town also reflects the literacy in that town.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160538_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160558_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>This looks like DVDs, they don’t look like second hand items, rather illegal copies.  </p><p>After entering Europe there are more sexual content items available.  </p><p>The other countries I had passed before are more conservative.  </p><p>This is the same type of store next to the bus stop.  </p><p>However, the items for sale in Poland are different from the ones in Russia.  </p><p>The difference will be even greater as I travel west. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160540_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Store selling mirrors, I am really a vampire, that is why the mirror doesn’t show me!  Sneeze!  I am cold!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160545_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The very ancient radios.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160550_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>By selecting one with good condition, then resell it to someone who understands who this is will bring lots of money.  </p><p>Because this is vacuum tube type radio, the size is big.  </p><p>Once the radios are made of electronic chips, they become smaller.  </p><p>The age of those radios should be more than 100 years old.</p><p> </p><p>Some booth will sell tea, coffee, or canned goods.  </p><p>Those types of things are dangerous, even more dangerous than ancient rifle.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160562_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The exterior looks perfect and pretty.  But flipping to the bottom, the expiration date has already been scratched off.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160561_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Continue selling things that are not sure how long this has expired; I suggest just purchasing this for collection.  </p><p>If someone you don’t like visits you, then you can make him a cup of this tea.</p><p> </p><p>Traditional disc, the product is in pristine condition, not much different to new items.  </p><p>However, purchasing this type of item will also require machine that will play them.  </p><p>Or buying this type of item will just for collection.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1160557_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is U2’s music and the cover is pretty. </p><p>One can find ancient musical and music goods, no wondering what you like you can find things you want at the flea market.</p><p> </p><p>There are too many interesting items here.  </p><p>If I talk about everything I will never stop.  </p><p>This type of market is available everywhere including Taiwan. </p><p>I encourage you to go and discover what you can find.</p>
