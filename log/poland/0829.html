										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-133_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">I left early today carrying a backpack containing 2 bottles of water, some chocolate biscuits, </span></p><p>map, and a camera.  I am going to Poznan’s zoo today.  </p><p>There is only one restaurant in the zoo and a store selling zoo merchandise.  </p><p>However, I don’t need to ask to know that the price at the zoo will be expensive.  </p><p>Whatever I need I will bring on my own.  I got the map from the visitor’s center.  </p><p>The bus ticket was bought previously.  I also got the map that Goose drew for me. </p><p>It contains the direction from the dorm to the bus stop, which bus I need to take, </p><p>and how I get from the bus stop to the train station.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170130_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I passed by bunch of couples in love on my way walking from the dorm to the bus stop.  </p><p>Even though I am by myself, I am determined to enjoy myself on this trip.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170133_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The bus stop across the street is where I will need to board the cable car. </p><p>I need to take number 6 cable car.  I will pass by 6 stops, total about 24 minutes.  </p><p>Therefore, I need 2 tickets with 10 minutes each for the 30 minute trip.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170135_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Within a few minutes, the cable car arrived.  </p><p>The cars here can’t drive on the electric cable car track so there is no traffic taking the cable car.  </p><p>The outside of the cable car looks very narrow, not sure how it will feel once I am inside. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170145_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The cable car has 3 connecting sections.  </p><p>Because there is no exact stopping point where the cable car stops at the station, </p><p>therefore one will need to press a button for the door to open when the cable car gets to the station.  </p><p>This way, there is no unnecessary doors opening and closing.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170138_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The little machine here punches the ticket.  It is very simple, this machine prints a time on the ticket.  </p><p>The moment the time count starts, is the time this ticket becomes in use.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170146_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Poznan got handsome men and beautiful women. </p><p> </p><p>Even though the cable car looks narrow from the outside, it is actually really spacious inside.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170149_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The light shines through the large windows.  I am satisfied looking at the scenery while riding the cable car.  </p><p> </p><p>Because the cable car does not broadcast each station’s name upon arrival, </p><p>so one must be careful which stop he/she needs to get out. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170150_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am sitting on the chair reading the information Goose gave me.  </p><p> </p><p>Goose especially printed out a list with times and stops that Number 6 will make. </p><p>I need to get to the stop where the blue arrow is pointing. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170156_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In a moment we will pass by a big bus stop followed by a right turn. </p><p>I will be getting off the cable car once it passes by this Lake District.  </p><p>Then I will walk over to take the little train.  This is it, the big bus stop.  </p><p>All Poznan’s car probably stops here as well.  Other than the big bus stops like this one, there are smaller bus stops. </p><p> </p><p>Look at the T-shirt the guy sitting in front of me is wearing.  By the looks of it, this is probably some Japanese anime.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170162_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The cable car stops at every stop; I counted 12 stops silently and then ready to get off.  I am here!</p><p> </p><p>Once the cable car stops, I have to press the button so the door will open.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170166_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>A very clear sign.  It is ok even if I don’t understand the words. </p><p>Just by looking at the train picture, I know I should follow the sign.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170167_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The little red roof in the front is where tickets for the train are sold.  </p><p>Right when I arrived here, I heard the train’s whistle blowing, whoooo~</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170169_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And then I saw the slowly moving train.  I didn’t expect this easy to reach the train ticket station.  </p><p>This means I am half way there.  I just have to get the train ticket now and I will be there.</p><p> </p><p>Walking to the ticket booth I was a little surprised.  </p><p>Other than on the weekends, the train only runs once an hour.  </p><p>Right now is 11:04am; the next train won’t come until noon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170176_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I saw the train moving earlier, I should have run to it and ask it to wait for me.  </p><p>But I laughed foolishly thinking I found the train station~! </p><p> </p><p>The old man selling the ticket said since the train won’t come until noon, </p><p>he can’t sell me the ticket now.  But he gave me a little guide to the train.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170177_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The total train rout is 3.55km (2.21miles).  There are only 2 stops, one is next to the lake, and the other one is the zoo.  </p><p>It looks like the zoo has been around 30 years or so.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at the train’s brochure, it makes me even want to ride it.  </p><p>The next train is the return train from the zoo.  I will need to find something to do for the next hour.  </p><p>Good thing this is very easy to do since there is a beautiful lake right here.  </p><p>One hour isn’t enough for me to walk around.</p><p> </p><p>The lake is very big, it is a natural lake.  </p><p>There is a canal which leads water from this lake to another man-made lake.  </p><p>The man-make lake is the one I saw when I had Indian food last time</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170184_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is an extremely tall fountain on the Lake.  </p><p>There aren’t a lot of clouds today, and very lucky it isn’t raining.  </p><p>The whole day has been cool so I didn’t sweat from my walk.</p><p> </p><p>There is a whole bunch of wild ducks next to the lake.  </p><p>The ducks swim back and forth looking to see whoever feeds them better tasting foods.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170192_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>That is them, looks a lot like the duck and apple I had yesterday.  </p><p>They are very skittish.  If anyone gets close to them, they immediately fly into the lake.</p><p> </p><p>The grass next to the lake is covered with feathers.  </p><p>Anyone can feed the pigeons in the park and anyone can feed the ducks next to the lake.  </p><p>Even though the ducks are scared, but for food they will get close to humans.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170205_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ducks eat similar food to pigeons.  By taking a loaf of bread and breaking it to parts, this can feed the ducks for awhile.  </p><p> </p><p>They are feeding nuts here, the ducks quickly left the old man over there and came over here. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170207_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The ducks are dumb.  By randomly taking some leaves and nuts and threw them on the water,</p><p>the ducks will come over and try to eat it. </p><p>Once the ducks found out they have been fooled, they will quack and then swim away. </p><p> </p><p>There are tons of ducks here.  The lake is greenish in color, but the water quality is pretty good.  </p><p>I can see the ducks’ legs busy moving and swimming under the water.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170213_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I haven’t gone to the zoo yet, and I already feel like I have seen the zoo already.  </p><p>It is good I brought some snacks along, or I would get hungry after looking at the ducks for so long. </p><p> </p><p>The water fountain shooting with streams half-sky high up.  </p><p>There are people rowing small boat on the lake.  The boat quickly moves across the lake.  </p><p>There are tons of white clouds in the sky.  I silently prayed there is no rain in the afternoon. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170227_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>There are lots of grass growing along the lake, reed, awn glass,etc that are particular to the lake.  </p><p>However, there are no plants such as duckweed and lotus plant.  The surface of the lake is very clean.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170231_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because this lake is maintained so beautifully, the rowing competition also takes place here.  </p><p>Therefore the surface of the lake must be kept clean so it wouldn’t affect the rowing competition.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170234_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>It takes at least 2 hours to walk once around the lake.  It wouldn’t take as long if I was biking or roller blading.  </p><p>There is a bike path, so the mom pushing the baby stroller wouldn’t collide into each other. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170238_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the pathway along the lake, very long and straight. </p><p>This one is for people walking; there is another pathway just like this one for the bikers.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170242_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If I get tired from the walk, I can rest a bit.  Looking at the beautiful lake, I am tempted to jump down and swim.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170244_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is a wonder no one is swimming in the lake even though there is a sign says no swimming in the lake. </p><p>Europe has stricter laws.  </p><p>If I am in Moscow, this lake would become a camping site with a swimming pool already. </p><p> </p><p>I walked a little bit more along the lake and then I heard the whistle from the train.  </p><p>The train has come back from the zoo.  </p><p>I quickly run back to where the ticket booth for the train is at or I will have to wait for another hour for the train.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170249_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Breathing heavily from my run, I saw there is only one train running.  </p><p>The mini train head is green with the compartment in blue and white color.  </p><p>In just a few minutes, the train is already filled with people.  I quickly run to get my ticket.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170257_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The zoo is very suitable for family to come, that is what most of the visitors are made of as well.  </p><p>The parents are here with their kids or the grandparents taking the grandkids.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170258_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Seeing a grandmother holding hands with a grandkid, I feel very warm inside.</p><p> </p><p>When I arrived here this morning the train just left so the ticket booth area was very empty.  </p><p>Now there are lots of people packed here in line waiting to purchase tickets.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170262_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The ticket isn’t expensive, $4.5 Zlit for adults single trip. </p><p>I wasn’t sure if there is a discount for round trip ticket.  Kids under 16 years of age the ticket is $2.5 Zlit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170266_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The train ticket is just a receipt, I hand the receipt to the train staff right before I board the train.  </p><p>He will stamp a date on the back of the receipt.  This means my ticket has been checked.</p><p> </p><p>It is a little troublesome looking at the small train.  The train is mostly filled already. </p><p>So I ended up finding a small seat squished next to this grandmother. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170267_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The train is a lot smaller than the cable car.  The seat of the car is very small, designed for the kids.  </p><p>The adults behind has a difficult time fitting into the seat.  </p><p>People are standing in the front compartment of this very crowded train.  </p><p>At exactly noon, the train’s whistle went off, started in the direction of the zoo. </p><p> </p><p>Looking at the train’s guide in the train; on the right side is the train schedule.  </p><p>Other than on the weekends, the train leaves the lake area once an hour on the full hour dot, </p><p>whereas the train leaves the zoo area once an hour at the half hour dot.  The last train is at 7pm.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170271_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are other ways to get to the zoo than taking the train since it is close by, such as walking, driving, or biking.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170279_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The train runs very slowly, 3.55km takes 15 minutes. </p><p>On the way to the zoo, the train kept passed by bikers.  </p><p>The train got to the zoo at the same time as this biking grandfather and granddaughter pair.  </p><p> </p><p>Arrived at the zoo!  Time to get off~</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170286_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The grandfather in the picture above already locked his bike up.  </p><p>The tourist here at the stop is the ones waiting for the return trip train from the zoo back to the lake.  </p><p>We are already in the middle of the forest, a very small train station. </p><p> </p><p>The guy in the dark green shirt is the conductor for the train.  </p><p>It is very amazing even though the train head looks like a huge toy but it runs.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170289_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The driver seat of the train, which button do I need to be pressed so that the train will blow its whistle?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170294_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I can either follow the people who just got off the train or follow the signs for the zoo direction.  </p><p>“DO ZOO” probably means This Way to the Zoo.  After this hill should be the entrance to the zoo.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170299_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>There are lots of people either in families or as couples visiting the zoo.  </p><p>Babies also come here visit the zoo, they being pushed in their strollers.  </p><p>Later when I see strollers in the zoo, they contain little sleeping babies visiting the zoo.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170302_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even before I entered the zoo, I saw this little shopping area contained with lot of animal related items. </p><p>Some of them look really cute.  </p><p>“Rolling on the ground back and forth, crying if you don’t get me this”</p><p>is something any kid around the world knows how to use.  I saw that here as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170305_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The ticket booth and the entrance are together, so once I got up the hill, I have to stand in line to get the ticket.  </p><p>The ticket prices for adults are $9 Zlit, half price for kids, and babies are free.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170308_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The zoo ticket is the one with the lion printed on it which says $9 Zlit.  </p><p>The zoo guide is the one with the big rhinoceros on it, which cost $5 Zlit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170314_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After I got the zoo guide I realized it is written in Polish.  It is good the zoo guide has tons of wonderful pictures in it. </p><p> </p><p>This zoo is a little bit big, so if I walk it will take awhile.  </p><p>The animals have lots of room to move around in their own exhibit.  </p><p>But some of the animals only have small room in their cages.  This includes an eagle that needs room to fly.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170344_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The zoo has six large lakes, lots of bird species resting by the lake.  </p><p>Because the zoo is so big, there is a train service available inside the zoo.  </p><p>However, I walked the whole day and didn’t see any sign of the train.  </p><p>This zoo doesn’t have a lot of different animal species, but it seems like the animals all live very comfortably here.  </p><p>I hope the eagle does get a new home one day.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone runs toward here once they enter the zoo.  </p><p>This usually means it is a petting zoo here where kids can touch the animals.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170316_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are lots of animals made of wood here.  </p><p>If Misasa sees this elephant, she probably would say, I want to ride, I want to ride.  </p><p>And then sit here the whole day and not going anywhere.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170319_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This hippo is also really cute.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170336_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A miniature pony and wagon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170338_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The petting zoo contained mostly of goats, the kind that has 2 horns on their head.  </p><p>This is the kind of goat that looks like the Poznan’s pin badge where 2 goats have their head against each other.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170489_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170327_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Inside the fence there are new born goats or kids and does that are pregnant. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170341_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I didn’t know kids are this cute, </p><p>next time when I go eat hot pot I won’t order kids to eat anymore, giving them some chance to grow up.  </p><p>Human kids and goat kids together.  I laughed so hard after being here awhile.  </p><p>The human kids holding grass to feed the goat kids, but once the goat kids came near the human kids,</p><p>the human kids got scared and run away. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170490_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then the goat kids runs over trying to eat the grass.</p><p>And then I see goat kids chasing human kids with the human kids trying to hide from the goat kids.  </p><p>The adults don’t go rescue the human kids; rather they stand aside laughing and taking pictures.  </p><p>Since it isn’t possible to be eaten by goat kids, the human kids are here to learn how to interact with animals. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170492_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>A sign about animals posted outside this fence.  It shows the name, the habitat, and a picture.  </p><p>I am not sure what the little caution sign with a panda in it on the upper left corner means.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170348_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Inside the zoo the path gets confusing.  Other than the major walkways, there are smaller paths in the zoo.  </p><p>Looking at this sign means do not enter, this is meant for staff entering certain zoo areas for the animals.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170349_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>An extremely big bird gate.  This reminds me of a bird cage scene in “The Persian Prince – Sand in a Moment of Time.”  </p><p>This area is big; I hear animal sounds all over not sure if the sound came from inside or outside of the cage.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170351_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Maybe there are very many animals living here already.  The area is planted with lots of greeneries.  </p><p>Other than the basic fence that separate the human and the animals, the areas for the animals and humans look the same.  </p><p>There are no special buildings built here, the zoo still contain the original forest look for the animal habitat. </p><p> </p><p>The bird leg is already really skinny; they are probably tired from standing all the time.  </p><p>When they sleep, they only stood with one leg; wouldn’t they fall over in their sleep?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170364_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The animal habitat is very open, if I didn’t see a sign posting what animals live here, </p><p>sometimes I wouldn’t see any animals at all.  </p><p>I was wondering if this area is filled with trees, but I saw some ladies kept taking pictures.  </p><p>Then I follow their gaze I realized there are giraffes here.  The areas they live in are very spacious.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170367_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though it is just a zoo here, the zoo here seems very different.  </p><p>When I see the zoo here I feel excited, seems like I am looking at wild animals not an icy cage holding bunch of lazy animals.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170370_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>One of the six lakes, the birds all freely roams around the lakes. </p><p>The birds are free to leave in the winter time, if they want to come back is ok too.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170388_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Swans~ Tons of ducks~ Pelicans and other large birds</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170422_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170429_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I feel like I am hiking in the zoo, breathing the clean fresh air in the forest, and looking at the animals became second.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170390_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The zoo sits on 116 hectares (287 acres) of land; it takes a long time to walk to see the whole zoo.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170398_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Very quickly I got separated from other visitors that came from the same train ride as I did because the size of the zoo is so big. </p><p>It is a good thing I still see other people here.  If I get lost, I will just follow them. </p><p> </p><p>Not sure what this sign means, stop crossing area? No picking of the plants?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170399_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Here are separated by some wood fence.  Inside is a large area holding lots of tigers.  </p><p>This sign sets on the edge of the exhibit.  Tiger is a fierce animal.  </p><p>Accidents could still happen with visitors running all around.  There is a small log cabin to watch the tigers. </p><p> </p><p>For safety, the visitors need to get up to the 2nd floor level, and look down to find the tiger inside the forest habitat.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170413_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is a picture of a tiger in the log cabin with sign on each of the tiger’s body parts.  </p><p>Walking closer and I saw that each note notes that the tigers’ parts are being slaughtered, </p><p>and then which part is used for which medicine.  </p><p>If we don’t take care of the animals, those beautiful animals will become extinct.  </p><p>Then we will only see those animals in Chinese Medicine stores.  </p><p> </p><p>New brush branches growing out from the side of the tree that has been cut.  It becomes like this once it grows big.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170427_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Presenting sleeping child.  No wonder the kids enter for free because they are sleeping from the time they enter.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170433_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I didn’t see the train, but I did see the train stop. </p><p>I sat on the bench and rest a bit.  The cool breeze blowing here makes me sleepy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170431_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The train’s route, looks like it is separated into 3 sections.  How come I didn’t see the train at all</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170459_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>When I sat on the bench napping, I got hit by this on the head.  This area contains monkeys.  </p><p>If this didn’t fall from a tree, then the monkeys threw this at me. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170436_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>That is them, the smelly faced monkeys.  They are from Japan.  </p><p>When I look closer at the picture, I see the monkey is holding a baby monkey.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170440_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Other than the wider walking path, I found lots of smaller paths that can cut across the forest.  </p><p>Those paths aren’t show on the map, I was a little surprised when I found them.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170451_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A very attractive forest path, this is different from the zoo I know.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170461_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In my memory, the zoos are covered with tourist, lots of fences and exhibit buildings. </p><p>Poznana’s zoo presents a feel of greenness and peacefulness. </p><p>This stretch of green law houses deer and birds.  </p><p> </p><p>On the bottom left corner of the picture shows see some very low fence that isn’t very noticeable.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170465_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I wonder why those animals wouldn’t run out of the fence.  </p><p>Maybe the area inside the fence is already very comfortable, similar to their natural habitat.  </p><p>There is also food to eat, so there is no reason to run away.  I saw a bigger deer housed here. </p><p> </p><p>The sign talks about the type of deer, the one with antlers, and has spots on its body.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170473_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are lots of species of deer here; this one is probably a mixed deer.  I am feeding it some snacks.  </p><p> </p><p>Even though I can not read Polish, I can still visit the animals I want by looking at the signs.  </p><p>The zoo has easy to understand signs posted, they use pictures rather than words.  </p><p>Thus I can tell by just one look at the sign what types of animals are housed in this direction.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170477_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The map showing routes in blue or red color are suggested path for visiting the zoo,</p><p>this allows the visitors to visit more animals before having to walk too much.  </p><p>The black color route is the longest visiting path; it is not possible to walk that route in less than two hours. </p><p>The only thing I didn’t get to see on this trip is the African animals.  </p><p>It is just too far away.  I sighed looking at the map.  I don’t get tired riding my bike but I got tried from the walk. </p><p>This is the only restaurant in the zoo.  </p><p> </p><p>The things they sell are really simple, soda with burger, and French fries.  </p><p>There is no price list, maybe the price kept going up so they got lazy trying to change the sign all the time. </p><p>Therefore they just decide not to have a price list at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170478_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is good I brought a lot of water and snacks.  By the time I finish it all, is time to go back and take a nap.</p><p> </p><p>I rode the train back to the lake area.  </p><p>Then I took cable car #6 back to the dorm, basically the route I took in reverse today.  </p><p>Today is a travel blog on the zoo.  If I put too many zoo animal pictures up, it will feel cold.  </p><p>Thus I didn’t put too many zoo animal pictures up.  </p><p>So I am putting up some pictures of beautiful girls. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170509_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The dinner today is made by Goose and Guerilla.  </p><p>Guys’ cooking isn’t any shabbier than girls’ cooking.  </p><p>When we were in Hsinchu, I was the one cooking and Misasa was the assistant.  </p><p>The kitchen in the dorm is pretty convenient.  This way whatever is made is much classier than Ramen Noodles.  </p><p>Plus the fact Goose and Guerilla are both foodies, so whatever we eat can’t be anything bad.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170521_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Eating so many varieties of food from different countries, </p><p>I still feel that I prefer food cooked by Taiwanese because they are homier.  </p><p>A whole plate of ribs glazed with honey, Napa cabbage stewed with chicken breast,</p><p>light, sweet, and tasty long melons, and nutritious beef soup. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170525_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I ate bowl after bowls of white rice.  Home cooking is much more economical than restaurant food. </p><p>Not only I am very happy to eat it, the interesting thing about cooking is its process.  </p><p>Once I get back to Taiwan, I can cook again.  </p><p>I have only been eating other people’s cooking; I feel I want to cook as well.</p><p> </p><p>I am not sure other than boiling water to make Ramen Noodles, what else the portable gas stove I am carrying can make?  </p><p>Tomorrow is Thursday, the last day I plan to be in Poznana.  </p><p>The only place I want to go to is to see Mucha’s art exhibit, to feel a little bit of artistic feeling. </p><p>I have to sleep well tonight so I can continue forward to Paris.</p>
