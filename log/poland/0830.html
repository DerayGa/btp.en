at the zoo yesterday.  </span></p><p>So today, other than going to Mucha’s art exhibit later in the afternoon, </p><p>I plan to stay in the dorm all day.  </p><p>Before I left for the art exhibit, I planned out which route I need to take for the rest of the trip from Germany to Paris.  </p><p>I decided I am not going to pass through Netherlands and Belgium this time.  </p><p> </p><p>In reality, I can still go through those 2 countries, </p><p>which adds 2 more countries to my list of the ones I have already passed.  </p><p>However, unlike Taiwan tourist groups, which uses the number of passing by countries as an advertisement.  </p><p>I feel quality is better than quantity.  Both Netherlands and Belgium are beautiful countries. </p><p>Riding my bike, I can pass those countries in about 2-3 days.  </p><p>But I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way.  </p><p>Rather than passing by quickly this time, I would rather take time on future trips to really enjoy those countries.  </p><p> </p><p>This is the route I plan to take:</p><p><img src="../../_Media/ge3_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="564" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I plan to take 1-2 days to ride to the Poland and Germany border.  </p><p>I won’t be going into Berlin because I would get lost in there. </p><p>I would ride in the southwest direction, avoiding all freeways with the blue signs.  </p><p>Maybe I will pass through Frankfurt and enter France right under Luxembourg.  </p><p>Then I may go a little bit into the Alps, directly riding west into Paris.  </p><p>That is, if everything goes the way I planned it.  I just have about 1300km (808 miles) left.  </p><p>It is a lot less than the 2000km or so I had thought.  </p><p>This makes me wonder if there is something wrong in my estimation. </p><p>Even if I ride slowly the rest of the way, the trip would end in about 2 weeks. </p><p>If no accidents happen, I should be in Paris by September 15th.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/ge2-2_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="592" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I plan to take 1-2 days to ride to the Poland and Germany border.  </p><p>I won’t be going into

trip would end in about 2 weeks. </p><p>If no accidents happen, I should be in Paris by September 15th.</p><p> </p><p>Before I left for my trip, I had planned to stay in hotels once I enter Europe.  </p><p>This is because there are lots of hotels along the way.  </p><p>There is no worry about safety, and the weather will also be nice.  </p><p>However, due to trying to save money, it is getting difficult to find places to camp for the night.  </p><p>It doesn’t feel great to get kicked out of my camping sites.  I am hoping this won’t happen again. </p><p>Also, it is getting into September, so the temperature in Europe is getting lower every day.  </p><p>It is a good thing I won’t be here during the winter time.</p><p> </p><p>After my afternoon meal I left for the art exhibit.  I feel a bit dizzy after being inside all day long.  </p><p>There should be good weather for another week.  </p><p>I hope I can still get this good weather all the way to Paris.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170529-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I walked a little to the castle where the exhibit was displayed at after taking the cable car first.  </p><p>The ticket at the art exhibit only cost 10 ZLIT for students.  </p><p>The exhibit is available from 11am to 7pm.  Apparently Mucha is a very famous artist.  </p><p>I guess the reason I have never heard of him is because my lack of knowledge. </p><p>I feel very fortunate to be able to see this artist’s work that is done over 100 years ago</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170533_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It seems like every country pronounces Mucha’s name differently.  </p><p>I heard Musha, Muha, and Muka today.  </p><p>It is strange his name is pronounced differently, so I just use the original name, Mucha. </p><p> </p><p>The display is inside the castle.  It is very elegant in there.  </p><p>The bright lights and the overall construction of the castle make the whole visit very comforting.  </p><p>There aren’t a lot of people here, so I feel even more comfortable looking at the exhibit.  </p><p>This is the marble staircase inside the castle.  The exhibit is separate into 3 halls.  </p><p>Before I enter each hall, the staff would tear a little corner piece off my ticket.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170542_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Mucha is a very famous artist from Moravia in the former Austrian Empire.  </p><p>He was born in the town of Ivancice.  </p><p>Most of his works are females, using beautiful scenery as the background.  </p><p> </p><p>His brush strokes are very fine, the colors are soft.  </p><p>With my untrained eye, when I first look at his work I felt the pictures looks like female cartoon.  </p><p>Then I feel the pictures look a bit like Japanese anime, similar to this Japanese artist, Otomo Katsuhiro’s, work.  </p><p>Most of Mucha’s work on display here are the ones around 1900s, some even earlier than that. </p><p>Even though the art works are over 100 years old, the paintings are still very colorful.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170564_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Here is a picture of Mucha on the wall.  </p><p>After looking at his picture, I am impressed with the fine details of his art work.  </p><p>Here is Mucha’s self portrait.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/mucha67-2_med_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="546" height="782" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Entrance to the exhibit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170571-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The entrance is covered with posters; this artwork seems to be the main representative of Mucha’s work.  </p><p>There are around 200 of his work on display here. </p><p>After looking at all his other artworks, I feel there are other works that are worth seeing than this one.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1170572-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Not only does this picture shows Mucha’s style and specialty, </p><p>his work sums up the foundation of his work which I am very impressed with.  </p><p> </p><p>Mucha not only painted, he also did fresco.  </p><p>Mucha also designed coins, pins, posters for operas, </p><p>menu for restaurants, and advertisement for hot chocolate.</p><p>As expected, I can not take photos in the exhibit.  </p><p>Here is a link for the exhibit : <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mucha/mucha.html" target="_blank">http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mucha/mucha.html</a></p><p> </p><p>If looking at the online photos isn’t enough, you can purchase Mucha’s art picture album in large bookstores.  </p><p>Really, I am not very familiar with artwork so I have never heard of this great artist’s name.</p><p>The exhibit store also sells some little things such as cards and calendars.  </p><p>Because I wasn’t able to take photos in the exhibit, I bought 3 bookmarks.</p><p> </p><p>In the exhibit there is a large painting of the Red Square done in 1914 when Mucha was in Moscow.  </p><p>In the picture, I can see the onion shaped domes of The Cathedral of St. Basil.  </p><p>Back then, the Red Square was a bazaar.  </p><p>Since I had just passed by Moscow, I feel this picture is particular special.  </p><p>I was able to stand at the same location 100 years later looking at the same scenery,</p><p>except now the peddlers became tourist taking photos.</p><p>One thing about Mucha’s work is they are all very large.  </p><p>Very many of the art pieces use large rectangular frames.  </p><p>Then Mucha uses the canvas to draw even more beautiful frames.  </p><p>This makes me feel that the character in the art will pass through time and walk out at any moment.  </p><p>Looking at those arts, it is hard to believe they are done by hand.  </p><p>The lines are very fine, and the most impressive thing is the use of colors.  </p><p> </p><p>This gives life to the art work.  Here are some Mucha’s art posted for everyone to enjoy.</p><p> </p><p>I really like one of the arts done in 1886, Mucha was only 26 then.  </p><p>In the picture there is a guy holding a girl and kidding her forehead.  </p><p>The girl was startled and dropped the bird seeds in her hand all over the ground.  </p><p>This particular picture doesn’t look like Mucha’s other famous works with their beautiful color and design.  </p><p>The characters don’t have the posture or the beautiful face like the other pictures.  </p><p>This small art piece is only 10 or so cm in length and width.  </p><p>Yet this small piece touched me the most, I can look at it for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>Too bad the exhibit store doesn’t sell any item with this art on it. </p><p>I am hoping I can find a picture album with Mucha’s work in it so I can look at Mucha’s work any time I want to.</p><p> </p><p>On the way to the dorm, dark clouds started gathering again. </p><p>It has been like this for several days.  During the night time it looks like it will rain but during the day time it is very sunny.</p><p>I am leaving Poland tomorrow.  I am hoping I will get some good sunny weather.  </p></div>
