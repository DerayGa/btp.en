										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-41_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">One after another truck driver checked into Xingxingxia hotel till midnight, </span></p><p>the empty parking lot had filled with a variety of trucks when I got up to watch stars late at night. </p><p>I felt thankful that the hotel owner did not let me share a room with the truck drivers, so I slept soundly. All the truckers snored very LOUDLY.</p><p> </p><p>I wanted to get an early start (around 6:00am) when it was still cool and attempted to eat breakfast before I set off. </p><p>However, the whole town was sleeping except me.</p><p>Nothing was open and nobody was selling breakfast till 7:00am. </p><p>Rather than wait for a breakfast, I got on the road and started a long ride today.</p><p>The key to finish a 200 km ride was to cover 100 km before noon when the wind was still gentle in the morning.</p><p>Even if the wind was picking up and slowing me down in the afternoon, </p><p>I could manage to get into Hami before sunset, but would be totally dog-tired though.</p><p>(Note: Hami is also known as Qumul)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040030_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Xingxingxia was asleep - no yummy breakfast. Filling up my bottles, I said farewell to the little town and headed off. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040032_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Today’s breakfast on the bike was three oranges, half a bag of peanuts, a few handfuls of raisins, water, and a large hotdog later. </p><p>With only three bottles of water, no matter how frugal I was with the water, I would probably finish it up by noon. </p><p>It was impossible to get to Hami without refilling the water.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040034_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The only place having food, drink and accommodation in the vast Gobi desert between Xingxingxia and Hami was named Luotuojuanzi.</p><p>(Note: Luotuojuanzi in Chinese means camel corral)</p><p>The map showed two names, Kushui and Dunyang, along the 150 km desert road. </p><p>I thought to myself, “If there were names on the map, would they be inhabited?”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040038_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I passed by, all that awaited me was just a road sign and the same desert, thirst, and long road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040053_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Some tough plants could still grow in the undulating desert, </p><p>but sometimes it was purely sterile and had no sign of life. </p><p>What fascinated me was the name, Gobi desert.</p><p>The desert used to be an extensive ocean long time ago, however it was dried up now. </p><p>What was left is the beautiful name. OK, that was my imagination running wild, the Gobi desert was never ever an ocean.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040046_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I like shabby stuff and barren landscape which helped me sort out what’s the point of life. </p><p>On average, I spent 10 hours each day on the bike looking at the land. </p><p>When the landscape changed from green to barren or alive to dead, I was affected deeply.</p><p> </p><p>What are people after? The answer is obvious that people are seeking for easy, </p><p>comfortable and convenient life and the necessity to sustain their lives.</p><p>If we have the choice for a better life, shall we make an effort to protect the earth? </p><p>Humans cannot survive alone, they need trees, mountains, clouds, the sun.</p><p>If everybody does a little something, it’s a cumulative effect. What’s more, </p><p>even the smallest of actions will “add up over time” to make a major impact on the environment.</p><p> </p><p>If humans have the extraordinary power to destroy the earth,</p><p>then we should recognize our responsibility to restore the earth’s ecosystems.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040036_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of the earth. </p><p>Unless the many places on earth survive, we cannot survive.</p><p>If we do not do it today, the earth will be completely consumed and destroyed. </p><p>The vital earth will be just part of the history of the universe.</p><p>Restore the earth before it is too late.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040045_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Parallel to Route 312 was a new highway from Xingxingxia to Hami. </p><p>It was still under construction and estimated to be finished in 2008.</p><p>Along the road, many road workers worked hard in the desert. </p><p>They would call out loudly to get my attention, and then waved at me. I would also wave back to acknowledge them.</p><p>There must be camps for road workers to stay in desert. I was in hope of seeing stores in the desert as at Shuangta Dam.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040084_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>However, there was nothing at all happening on the road except the wind started picking up as the temperature was going up.</p><p>I had only half bottle of water left by noon, even though I had cut down water consumption greatly. </p><p>The good news was I had done 100km at noontime.</p><p>It was likely that I could make it to Hami today as long as I was not thirsting to death in the desert….</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040054_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Spotting a road works’ camp in the desert, I decided to check it out. </p><p>Even if there was nothing there, I had nothing to lose but rode a few more meters.</p><p>I asked the first person I saw in the camp “Do you sell beverage?”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040072_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This person was the supervisor in charge of the construction department.</p><p>He said nothing for sale, walked into the inner room, and then brought back a bottle of green tea for me.</p><p>“It is hot, you must be thirty, take this” said the supervisor.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040056_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Tears welled up in my eyes. I was invited to his office for a rest. </p><p>He was busy inspecting the work quality done by the road workers from various places.</p><p>When having a short break, the supervisor said “eat lunch with us in the dining hall later”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040058_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was always so lucky to come across many nice people who would help a stranger from far away for nothing but a thank-you.</p><p>Taking out three empty water bottles, I asked the supervisor where to refill my water bottles.</p><p>“There is a small 24 hr water boiler next to the large water tank outside of the camp. Hot water is ready at anytime.” said the supervisor </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040061_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I did not see a large black dog beside the water tank at first and was startled when seeing him. </p><p>He was just a nice guard dog and did not bite. </p><p>The water bottles became soft after being refilled with hot water. I laid them in shades to cool down.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040060_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The road workers got up at 8:00am, had lunch break from 1:30pm to 3:00pm, and then kept working till 8:00pm for dinner. </p><p>They worked seven days a week with no weekends.</p><p>I was catching some zz’s in the office before lunch when the supervisor’s assistant woke me up for lunch.</p><p>The dining hall was located behind the camp and a menu was posted on the wall. </p><p>They got better meals every Wednesday and Sunday. Lunch for Monday (today) was lamian.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040066_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Everybody brought their own chop sticks and laid their own large bowls/lunch boxes on the table outside of the kitchen, </p><p>and then the cook filled the bowls/lunch boxes with noodles and sauce.</p><p>The bigger the bowl was the more noodles it got! </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040065_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Without my own tableware, I walked into the kitchen, asking the cook if he had a bowl or something to make me a noodle lunch.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040067_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It turned out my lunch was braised lamb lamian on a big plate with many sweet vegetable stems - free and tasty!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040069_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Lunch was finished after 2:00pm. During their break time,</p><p>I was off with the gratitude from the bottom of my heart since I had a good 100 km ride to look forward to.</p><p>Many thanks for all their help!</p><p> </p><p>Some insects were flying along the desert road– honey bees. Unbelievable! </p><p>No beekeepers, no beehives, and no flowers in the desert -- where did they come from?</p><p>I did not care at the beginning, just felt amazed. However, as I was climbing a steep hill and slowing down a bit, </p><p>the honey bees started catching up to me.</p><p> </p><p>They kept bumping into my head, buzzing my ears and landing on my hands, clothes and face.</p><p>I shook my head to get rid of them from my face at first. Later on, I was a bit irritated and started flailing my hand over my head.</p><p> </p><p>It had no effect on the result but it made the bees became more aggressive. </p><p>When I sensed that, I took off my hat and swatted them away with my hat. </p><p>It only made things worse, so that the bees were pissed off and started attacking and stinging me.</p><p>Since I had sunglasses and a gauze mask on, the printed bandana became their attack target. </p><p>My forehead where it was not covered by the bandana got stung.</p><p>A few bees stung me on my forehead - OUCH, what an agonizing pain. </p><p>The stinger was left in my forehead skin and I had to remove it in great pain.</p><p>Oh man! I was attacked by homeless honey bees in the middle of nowhere!</p><p> </p><p>I waved my hat too hard and knocked down my sunglasses. </p><p>I got stung again as picking up my sunglasses.</p><p>Are honey bees poisonous? How many bee stings a human can bear?</p><p>Way too many bees! Waving my hat only worsened the situation.</p><p>Pulling down the bandana to cover my forehead, putting my hat back on,</p><p>I crossed through to the other side and rode on the wrong side of the road where fewer bees were.</p><p> </p><p>I badly wanted to speed up and escape as quickly as possible. </p><p>However, I was stuck on an uphill and could not ride as fast as I wished.</p><p>Thanks to a rush of adrenalin and passing trucks I got away. </p><p>I climbed over the hilltop, cycling like mad. </p><p>The wind made by the high-speed trucks swooshing down the road helped break up the crazy bee swarm as well.</p><p>I thought honey bees were harmless, but they just attacked me without mercy. </p><p>Wasn’t I friendly to you all the way, talking to you and avoiding the ones on the ground. Why are you treating me cruelly in return?</p><p>I stopped and applied a thick layer of Mentholatum to the bee sting area to reduce the toxicity and stayed on the wrong side of the road. </p><p>I looked at the bees across the road hovering in the air. It seemed that they wanted to sting me if I ever rode back.</p><p>When checking up my forehead, I saw a purple red bump which hurt a bit but was ok,</p><p>and there was a stinger still staying in the forehead skin.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040078_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Later on, I rode back on the correct side of road.</p><p>When I was on the wrong side of road, the wind made by the high-speed trucks almost pushed me off the road to the desert. </p><p>It felt like I was a small insect being hit flat by a huge air-made flyswatter.</p><p> </p><p>Arriving at Luotuojuanzi around 5:00pm, I was back to civilization. Hey, congratulate me! </p><p>I had done another 150 km of the Gobi desert safely!</p><p>This place was just like a truck stop. I bought a bottle of cola and two ice pops at a small store to celebrate my getting out of trouble.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040079_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two questions for the store owner.</p><p>“Why it is called Luotuojuanzi?” </p><p>There was no camel whatsoever, to reflect the truth, it should be named “Truck Corral”</p><p>“It was said that there were camel caravans here a long long time ago. </p><p>It was called Luotuojuanzi since she was born” said the lady owner.</p><p> </p><p>“How come there are so many honey bees along the road?”</p><p>“Got Stung?” said the lady owner with laugh on her face</p><p>I held up three fingers to show my poor situation.</p><p>She said it was quite painful right after being stung, but it would be fine within 2 days. </p><p>They often got stung and had become used to it.</p><p> </p><p>The beekeepers shipped their bees by truck. Because the trucks were overloaded, </p><p>the police kicked them off the national highway.</p><p>The bee trucks were allowed to get back on the national highway only at night. </p><p>When the trucks were waiting on the roadside, the bees flew out of their beehives. </p><p>In addition, some stupid bees did not wear seatbelts and fell out the beehives along the road.</p><p>Since they could not catch up to their trucks, they were left out on Route 312 and became homeless honey bees.</p><p>So, they were doomed to a death in the desert – but before that, they had time to buzz around or sting some poor guy like me occasionally.</p><p>I felt pity for them and did not hate these bees anymore, even I just had a hostile fight with them.</p><p>Die in peace.</p><p> </p><p>About 60 km to Hami, I could either get there around 9:00pm, or call it a day and stay in Luotuojuanzi tonight.</p><p>What the heck! I had done 150 km already, should the last 60 km matter?</p><p>Kudos to the cola and ice pops, I was powered up again.</p><p>At the dusk, the gust wind would die down and the low thick clouds would block the annoying afternoon sun. </p><p>Removing the gauze mask and taking off my hat, I set off into the desert once more.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040086_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the solitary atmosphere, I thought of the people that I had met and the thing that had happened.</p><p>The vivid memories were frightening, </p><p>what had happened reappeared one after the other – it felt like a man looked back over his life on his death-bed.</p><p>It is unbelievable that I am traveling at this place, at this moment. </p><p>How many decisive encounters make me who I am as of today?</p><p> </p><p>At 9:00pm, Hami was only 5 km away but the entire roadway was dug up like a WWI trench.</p><p>I did not want to stay in the suburbs, so the last 5 km was finished by walking or riding. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040088_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then, the bustling city was in sight.</p><p>Tables and chairs lined the ten meter wide sidewalk, taking it up entirely. </p><p>Hundreds of people were having BBQ or clay pot, drinking beers, and having fun.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040091_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had made up my mind without a second thought that I would find a hotel near this place and came back to enjoy myself as well.</p><p>Spotting a hotel on the corner, I was about to yell out if anybody was there, </p><p>when the hotel owner came out. His family was heading for dinner.</p><p>If I was one minute later, nobody would have taken care of me – very lucky.</p><p>I might take a break in Hami for a few days, not decided for how long though.</p><p>I just asked a room for two nights - 20 RMB per night.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040096_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A single room was usually quite small. No matter how small the room was, </p><p>I always insisted on keeping Dido in the room with me.</p><p>“I can not sleep without my bike next to me” – that was my answer if the hotel owner ever asked me.</p><p>I took a comfortable sponge bath. </p><p> </p><p>My dinner was waiting for me on the bustling street.</p><p>I biked hard to Hami today and deserved an award – a great meal.</p><p>I picked and chose a yummy BBQ restaurant, and ordered grilled lamb kebab, </p><p>grilled lamb steak, baked biscuits and a ice cold Tsingtao Beer.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040098_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Enjoying good food was always the happiest time of the day. It was telling me that I had finished up a hard day’s work.</p><p>Thanks to the honey bees, you made another meaningful moment in my life.</p><p><br /></p>
