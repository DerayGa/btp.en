										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-8_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I didn’t know what was wrong with the weather. </span></p><p>was very hazy in the morning but it didn’t feel like it was going to rain,</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000819_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A few minutes after I departed, I heard someone saying hello from the back. </p><p>I turned around, there was someone riding a bike, too.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000820_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>His name is Lee Jih-Min. He is riding from Zhengzhou, Henan to Beijing, Hebei. </p><p>It will only take him 10 days to make a round trip if he rides 150 kilometers a day.</p><p>He is riding a bike made by Merida. He must not an amateur. Come to find out, not only he is going to Beijing for pleasure, </p><p>Merida is also sponsoring him and he will get some prices from the company if he finishes this trip.</p><p> </p><p>I saw him riding casually with a red bike and red gears; I thought he must be a young man.</p><p>I told him I am 27 years old and how old are you?</p><p> </p><p>“I am 40 years old… I have a son already.”</p><p>What! You take care yourself very well!</p><p>“It’s not take care of myself well, is covering myself well.”</p><p>Indeed, look at him wearing a mask to cover his whole face. This way he is not afraid of blowing sand and getting his face dirty.</p><p>I am envy he has a mask. But since I didn’t bring one, I will have to forget about it.</p><p> </p><p>Originally I was planning to take advantage of the coolness of early morning to cover as much distance as possible, </p><p>so I deliberately rode very quick in order to pass him.</p><p>“I will go first… I need to get to Zhengzhou today.”</p><p>Less than 3 minutes later, it was his turn to pass me. So I have to say I want to ride slow so I can enjoy the scenery along the way.</p><p>“Brother Lee, you go first… :-)”</p><p> </p><p>I got stuck in a ridiculous traffic jam. Whole bunch of trucks and trackers all got stuck in the road. </p><p>Then every one was driving on the dirt road.</p><p>That made things even worst. There was no space for me to ride. So I had to get off and walked in the dusty air. </p><p>I walked for a few hundred meters and then found out there were two roads merging into one up front </p><p>and there were many cars on both sides but neither side seems willing to budge.</p><p>So every one just got stuck in the intersection.</p><p>I don’t know how long this traffic jam is going to last.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000832_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Some tractors carried a huge pile of hays. From the back you can only see a stack of hays moving. Very funny.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000844_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After riding 107 national freeway for a few days, all the sudden, it disappeared today. </p><p>Unknowingly, I got on “Xinzheng First Class Highway.”</p><p>From the name itself, this must be the road from Xinxiang to Zhengzhou. But what is “First Class”?</p><p>The English translation is “First Class Highway”, is it a Highway?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000848_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I saw the barriers start appearing on both sides of the road and an “EXIT” sign every 10 km or so.</p><p>Then there was the rest area in half way.</p><p> </p><p>Did I get on the highway by accident again?</p><p>Even though that was very possible, but no one was stopping me on this very much likely to be a highway.</p><p>The only reason I am continue riding because I didn’t see any sign indicated bicycles are prohibited.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe China is the most suitable country to travel by bikes. </p><p>In China, except highways and railroads, you can pretty much ride on any roads.</p><p>Some roads will not allow tricycles, horse-drawn carriages, tractors, motorcycles, trucks and rickshaws. </p><p>But I haven’t seen any roads prohibit bikes. </p><p> </p><p>Like yesterday, it was a slightly headwind weather.On this first class highway, I didn’t get off from any exits.</p><p>So I will pass Xinxiang and head to the destination Zhengzhou.</p><p>On this first class highway, except for exits, there were no restaurants and vendors so I didn’t have anything to eat.</p><p>At noon, I stopped at Xinxiang rest area. In this huge ruin like lonely rest area,</p><p>I ordered some fast food for 10 RMB, one portion of meat and two portions of vegetables, from a lady who looked sleepier than me. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000851_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I brought the tray to a table that was closest to Dido, </p><p>just as I was getting ready to start eating, the sleepy server said “Do not split on the floor”</p><p>Do I really look that messy? </p><p>Why is she telling me specifically not to split on the floor? Do I look like someone will do that?</p><p>I turned around and forced a smile at her and started my lunch.</p><p> </p><p>With the rate I am going, if bikes are allowed on this first class highway and I don’t get stopped by the police, </p><p>I should be able to get to Zhengzhou, a pretty big city in the central China, before 5 o’clock.</p><p>After arrive Zhengzhou, I will have a whole day to rest. I can wandering around or sleep for a whole day to recover.</p><p> </p><p>At 3:30 in the afternoon, I arrived at the Yellow River Bridge.</p><p>I remembered then, how come I didn’t see the river when I was riding from Hebei (means north of river) to Henan (means south of river), </p><p>since I was supposed crossing the river?</p><p> </p><p>Before got on the Yellow River Bridge, there were signs indicated pedestrian and bikes are prohibited. I asked the guard on the bridge.</p><p>“How can I cross the bridge with a bike?” and pointed to the two signs prohibiting me and Dido to pass.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000857_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The guard was very cool. He looked exactly like Chinese, but when he spoke, he sounded like a Spanish person speaking Chinese.</p><p>Is that how you speak Hanan accent by mimicking a foreigner speaking Chinease? That’s not too difficult.</p><p> </p><p>The guard said this is a narrow bridge and with traffic in high speed, I should not be riding. It’s too dangerous.</p><p>What! If I can’t ride then how do I cross the river. </p><p>Is there another way to cross the Yellow River? Do I just walk Dido over the bridge?</p><p> </p><p>That was it. That was the solution. </p><p>Even though pedestrians and bikes are prohibited, but it does not prohibit a pedestrian walk a bike to cross the bridge.</p><p>I really didn’t understand this logic. But since the guard said so, I would just do so.</p><p> </p><p>Walking the bike cross the bridge, there was wheat planted below the bridge.</p><p>All these days, there was wheat planted along the roads.</p><p>From far way, you can’t tell the difference between wheat and aquatic rice plantation. </p><p>Until you get close and you will find the soil was dry unlike aquatic rice must be planted in paddy field.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000829_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The wheat plantation extended endlessly, the bridge seemed very long. </p><p>I didn’t know when I would be able to finish walking across this bridge.</p><p>After walked for half hour, I started riding again along the sidewalk on the bridge and moving steadily.</p><p>I though the Yellow River must be very wide with roaring waves and flow into the sea with grandeur. </p><p>The river should be so wide that you can’t see the other side of the bank if you are standing on this side of the river. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000871_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But when I saw it in person, even though it was really wide, but still it is not as big as I though.</p><p>But the water was extremely yellow, full of dirt. </p><p>The wheat plantation along the Yellow River must be planting on the deposits from the Yellow River. An extraordinarily fertile plain.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000866_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Passed the Yellow River is Zhengzhou. Riding on the Garden Road, it felt like one of those European boulevards. </p><p>You get a sense that the government want to develop Zhengzhou into a big city in the central China. This will be a likeable place.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000878_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Strolled down the road and checked if there were any hotel signs. Luckily I found the hotel streets.</p><p>The street was full of loud Taiwanese pop music. Young men were playing pools, bystanders were no longer paying any attention to me.</p><p>I found a comfortable room for 30 RMB. Because the room was very comfortable, so I decided to stay here for two nights.</p><p>One night was 30 RMB, two nights were 55 RMB with 5 RMB discount, not bad at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000880_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There was a screw loosen in Dido’s front rack and I couldn’t screw it back because the threads were already wear off.</p><p>I will need to find a welding place tomorrow and ask them to weld all the screws in the front and back racks. </p><p>This way it will give me a peace of mind while riding the bike.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner was taking care of at the night market. </p><p>The atmosphere was about the same as the night market in Taiwan with one exception, the price was much cheaper here.</p><p>There were a lot of street vendors selling food. It was a big struggle walking down the street because I want to try everything.</p><p>Finally I picked a wonton vendor. A big bowl of wonton soup was 3 RMB. It was as big as a washbasin and filled with wontons.</p><p>No wonder the woman making the wontons was so fast. If she was slow, then they wouldn’t be able to serve all the customers.</p><p>I counted while I was eating this big bowl of wonton soup. There were total of 25 wontons (and I am stuffed).</p><p> </p><p>Before I got back, I bought a sweet potato weighted at least 1 kilogram (3 RMB) for snack when I watch TV and read a book.</p><p> </p><p>While I was at the night market, I found an internet café. </p><p>If I have nothing to do tomorrow, I can spend some time here. That’s if I can get Dido fixed first.</p><p> </p><p>I am so blessed to plan some free days in this trip.</p><p>Tomorrow let’s have a one day tour at the Yellow River!</p><p><br /></p>
