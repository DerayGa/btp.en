										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-58_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Because the size of the regular steamed buns is kind of small for me, </span></p><p>I usually eat them like the way I would eat “Little Basket Buns (or Soup Dumplings, a tradition Shanghai food). </p><p>“Normal” people can eat 3-5 for breakfast. I, on the other hand, </p><p>usually get the whole basket of the steamed buns. </p><p>It turned out that the buns at this breakfast place were bigger than I expected, </p><p>I ate the whole 10 buns-with pork filling, plus one salty tofu pudding, and I was way too stuffed.</p><p>“Carrying” my full stomach, I really wanted to take a nap at the hotel. </p><p>I thought maybe this could be a brunch, save some money, too.</p><p>Just when I started paddling, my right foot stupidly kicked the protection plate on the bike. </p><p>It was a bit loose before, and now, it was broken. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060276_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Thank god that it was not a critical part of my Dido, might as well just took it out completely, and that was what I did.</p><p> </p><p>I saw less people after leaving Jinghe, but compared to Gobi Desert, it was still full of life at this area. </p><p>You could even see green here and there.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060330_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was riding alongside the mountain track, on which the mountain was on my left. </p><p>The snow on the top of the mountain seemed never melt. </p><p>Right now, the clouds on the top brought out a really nice mountain silhouette.</p><p>Whenever I felt hot, I took a glance at the mountain to cool down myself.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060298_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two hours later, I arrived at the Toto gas station, you know, gas station is my best friend:</p><p>“Cold water to wash my face, free. </p><p>Nice shade to cool down, free.</p><p>Great coke, 3 RMB.</p><p>One hour to relax, priceless.”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060313_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I took off the shoes and socks, sat next to the gas pump to have my lunch—a can of coke and a couple of crackers</p><p>(don’t forget the 10 buns from the breakfast were still somewhere in my digestive system).</p><p> </p><p>Well, couldn’t help but falling asleep after lunch, as usual. A slow day for the gas station is a great day for me, </p><p>because I don’t have to worry about being disturbed while taking my nap.</p><p>Around 2 o’clock, I woke up and continued my trip. Luckily, the wind was on my side this afternoon. </p><p>I was so tired of riding against the wind through most part of China. </p><p>I only hope my luck can continue even when I enter Kazakhstan later.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060309_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Where there is grass, there is animal farming. </p><p>Those cute little lambs making the bah bah sounds so loud that made me feel so hungry (dripping water from mouth).</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060286_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>About one hour after I left Toto gas station, I saw two bikers on the other side of the road. </p><p>We saw each other at the same time. Because this national highway was divided by barriers for the two opposite traffic, </p><p>I had to lean my Dido on the barrier and climbed over to say Hi.</p><p> </p><p>They definitely don’t look like Chinese, so I talked to them in English.</p><p>It turned out that they are a retired couple from France. </p><p>They started at Kazakhstan, and destination is Tibet, and today is their 10th day on the road. </p><p>Even they are 62 years old already; they are still very actively pursuing their dream.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060314_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Fleck can speak some English, and I can speak very limited French. </p><p>But we certainly had a good time talking to each other.</p><p> </p><p>The first question they asked me was, if there was food and drink around. Well, they certainly looked beat. </p><p>I told them just to hang in there a little longer and they can find that gas station I just took a nap at. </p><p>They of course were very glad to hear the good news.</p><p> </p><p>These are their bikes. They had more luggage than I did, even they shared the load, </p><p>but you can still see there are lots of weights on both of them. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060315_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>They mostly camped on the road, unless they really needed to take a shower, so they had a much tougher time that I did.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060316_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Fleck really cared about her nails. However, this trip had already ruined her nice polished nails.</p><p> </p><p>They lived at the East part of France. I told them that I toured France two years ago and I might even passed by their town. </p><p>I will visit France again at the end of this BTP tour.</p><p>Fleck had a special notebook, not only she kept diary of their trip there, </p><p>she also kept many pictures of their grandkids in this notebook. </p><p>Fleck’s face was all lit up when she showed me the photos, she even pointed at the photos,</p><p>as if she can make those kids laugh just by doing this.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060321_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Like I said, they are already 62; they can easily stay in France to enjoy life. </p><p>Even if they really want to visit Tibet, they can go by other means. </p><p>But they just chose to bike there, a rather challenging way.</p><p> </p><p>Their bikes were very “cute”: both of them had puppets on their bike handles. Jacquin has a giraffe, and Fleck has two bears.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060318_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060323_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Both of their bikes have rear mirrors as well, however, I did notice that their water bottles were empty,</p><p>no wonder the first thing their asked me was about food and drink. </p><p>I offered my water, but they wanted me to keep that for myself. </p><p>Jacquin wore a hat with a pair of long “ears”, which can block the sun. Ha…. Under that hat is ---his head ONLY.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060317_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Although Jacquin didn’t speak English, we still managed to have a great time through Fleck’s translation both ways. </p><p>They asked how it was possible for me to keep the jacket and pants on in a hot day like this. </p><p>I took a closer look at them, they wore shirts, but their sleeves were rolled up high, so the exposed area got really serious tanned.</p><p>I explained that it is really important to “cover” yourself up, especially in a sunny day like today.</p><p>I also showed them my well-protected arms/hands--not tanned. I thought they finally got my point, hopefully.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060327_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was so happy to meet “my” kind of people—travel on bike. We exchanged e-mail address, </p><p>and I would send them the photos once I found the internet.</p><p>Fleck gave me a big hug and a light kiss on my cheek. I was a bit embarrassed. </p><p>So I hugged Jacquin and said, “Sorry to hug your wife”.</p><p> </p><p>About 40 more kms later, I would arrive today’s destination—Jinghe. </p><p>On the way there, all I could think of was weather they found the gas station or not. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060356_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This national highway was fenced on both sides, so it was not likely for vehicles or pedestrians to leave the road.</p><p>The villages along this highway now looked even lonelier by standing out there.</p><p>Restaurants or hotels, garages or stores, only the signs were still hanging there.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060303_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Ah! I found the guilty one—the way they repaired the road. </p><p>It seemed like they cracked the road in the middle first, and then the hot asphalt was poured directly onto it. </p><p>The repair process would be completed when the asphalt was dried. Unfortunately, </p><p>I came to this road while the asphalt was still wet, so my Dido took the heat by carrying this black sticky stuff on its tires.</p><p>It took a whole day to cool down/dry the asphalt, so the tires finally stopped picking up rocks everywhere I went.</p><p>It was really a hard work to scrap those rocks off the tires.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060336_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Before entering Jinghe, I saw a sign saying “Yurt”.</p><p>I detoured to check it up, because it sounded a fun place to visit, and free, too?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060341_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060343_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, what I saw was a couple of colorful sticks, and little “hill” made with rocks.</p><p>On the top of the “rock hill” were several tree branches with many ribbons. And this is called Yurt.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060354_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is how it got started. It was just an empty place, like any ordinary place. </p><p>Then one day, someone walked here, rested a bit, and he/she stacked one rock on top of another. </p><p>Then he/she put up a tree branch, then he/she tied a ribbon on the branch, </p><p>then he/she left. People passed by afterwards did the same. Years and years later, we have this at this place.</p><p> </p><p>One hour later, I finally arrived at Jinghe. </p><p>I would have to climb all the way up whole day tomorrow, so I really needed to find a comfortable bed to rest well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060361_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The city was so full of live, that I almost couldn’t believe that I was in a deserted area one hour ago. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060367_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I chose a hotel that was right next to a night market, and I couldn’t wait to stuff myself.</p><p>I was going to use the money I saved from this cheap hotel to award my stomach. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060386_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had a chicken casserole and a bottle of local Wusu beer for dinner. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060389_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then I felt that there was something missing, so I ordered five lamb shish kebobs. </p><p>Remembered the lambs I saw today, and I told you that made me so hungry? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060391_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dinner time is my happiest moment of a day.</p><p> </p><p>This was the sky at 10:30 at night, still way too bright. </p><p>I bet the moms here can never tell their kids that “Remember to come home before it gets dark”, </p><p>because….. Kids will probably never come home untill mid-night.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060397_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The bright sky always confused me about the real time, or which time zone I should follow. </p><p>I guess I would have to adjust myself after entering Kazakhstan then.</p><p><br /></p>
