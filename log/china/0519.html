However, an hour later, </p><p>around 8:00am, the temperature worked its way up again as yesterday.</p><p>There was no breakfast shop and I did not want to ride with hunger. </p><p>When I spotted a store, I was super happy and dashed into the store. I could not wait to see what goodies the store would have.</p><p>Excluding food like instant noodles and milk powder that required preparation,</p><p>I bought one bag of egg yolk cookies, two bags of milk and three bags of peanuts, totaling seven and half RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020404_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I breakfasted on milk and peanuts. The plastic bag garbage was stuffed into my pant pocket. </p><p>I would throw them away in the right place later.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020426_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The side road was on a plateau at 2000m above sea level,beautiful but barren. </p><p>I did not want to leave garbage at such serene and unspoiled place.</p><p>The wide plateau and the range of mountains in the far distance did not give me the feeling that I had been at high altitude.</p><p>Nearly all of what I could see was the sky. </p><p>The sky was various shades of blue with no clouds. The sun was high up behind my back.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020428_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Along the way, I saw a small dirt mound topped with a few stones and a stele. </p><p>Could it beeeeeeee what I imagined – a booooooody was buried inside?!?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020413_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Barren land is on both sides of the road. </p><p>As the side road did not have a road fence, I could ride anywhere I wished.</p><p>I rode into the arid terrain where some plants grew in clumps with stiff spiny leaves.</p><p>I stomped on the grass a few times (excuse me, I was really silly). </p><p>It seemed that nothing ever happened to them, they were very tough. </p><p>No wonder they could survive in such a harsh environment.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020444_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking down and taking a closer look, by surprise, </p><p>I spotted few yellow or purple flowers among the grass clumps.</p><p>Not only tough plants with stiff spiny leaves could thrive in desert, </p><p>but fragile little flowers could also adapt to the harsh environment and grow. </p><p> </p><p>It was hard to believe that the sterile terrain could grow mushrooms! </p><p>Along the road, many small store signs said “mushrooms for sale” with hanging red plastic bags. </p><p>However, it puzzled me that where the mushrooms were raised.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020456_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Slowly and casually rode down the road, every morning I started with a laid-back riding and a delightful meal.</p><p>Until 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon, I would start pushing on to catch up my schedule, </p><p>and swear to myself that I would go to bed early and set off early tomorrow.</p><p>However, two days later, I repeated the laid-back manner again – </p><p>enjoying a delightful ride before noon and having a tiring ride after lunch.</p><p>Usually the sun was getting hotter and the headwind started picking up in the afternoon. </p><p>I always had two different moods in one day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020476_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I stopped for lunch in Fengcheng, a very dry little town.</p><p>Taking off my sunglasses, my eyes were not able to adjust to the brightness. Everything I saw was like overexposure. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020463_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Lunch of a pot stewed pork lamian, the pork and tofu together with the noodles </p><p>were so delicious that it made me feel like giving the store owner a hug in tears!</p><p>(Note: lamian is hand-stretched noodle)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020465_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The large portion of noodles really filled me up.</p><p>While I was eating, a very cute little girl was running around in front of me.</p><p>She was quite different from the other kids I saw this morning who had faces as red as Guan Gong.</p><p>(Note: Guan Gong, a historical figure well known for his role in the novel </p><p>‘The Romance of the Three Kingdoms’, is traditionally portrayed as a red-faced warrior)</p><p> </p><p>I thought people here were exposed to the intense sun because of the high altitude, </p><p>therefore, their faces were either dark or red. It turned out there was a kawaii one!</p><p>(Note: kawaii is Japanese which means cute)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020471_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After lunch I hit my side road again. The side road began to disappear a while later, </p><p>only a hole in the fence left for me to get on the highway.</p><p>I had been quite experienced in riding on the highway, OK, I could do it one more time!</p><p>What a pity, a well constructed highway with such little traffic. </p><p>I swerved back and forth with no car honking me, because there were none.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020477_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As long as I could cover 18 km safely on the highway and then get off, I was happy.</p><p>Hopefully, I won’t get kicked off by the highway patrol. I prayed in silence, soon a police car whooshed by.</p><p>The police car did not seem to care about my presence. Was this not a highway??</p><p>When getting off the ramp, I sneaked out to avoid toll booth operators, then turned and had a look… no doubt about it, it was a highway.</p><p>Thank god, the highway patrol did not wave me down. Well, I was curious to know what might happen if I got caught.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020480_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I took the exit ramp to Shangdan. Soon after coming off, I found shelter in a gas station. </p><p>I felt I was getting heat stroke.</p><p>I bought a bottle of fruit milk, so I could stay in the gas station without guilt. </p><p>The gas stations in China are run by “PetroChina” which bears the same name as the gas stations in Taiwan. </p><p>As I was in biking clothes, the gas station operator said “PetroChina, we fuel up your heart” to me.</p><p>Wow, the slogan was so familiar. Not only was the name the same as in Taiwan, but they also picked up the same slogan?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020484_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I just wanted to cool off at the gas station after finishing the fruit milk. </p><p>Suddenly I felt sleepy and very soon fell asleep.</p><p>It was a half an hour of deep sleep. </p><p>How deep? I drooled in my sleep.</p><p>Was I so beat?</p><p> </p><p>With an altitude drop, the sad arid landscape changed back to green fields.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020489_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020490_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>My sun hat got blown off and swept away by water the other day. </p><p>However the intense afternoon sun took no pity on me. </p><p>Where was my hat? I felt so sorry for losing some useful gear that I needed.</p><p>Even though I applied sunscreen on my face, I doubt it could protect me from the afternoon sun. </p><p>I put on a gauze mask to cover my face as the lady farmers in the fields did.</p><p>A bank robber!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020486_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It felt great to ride with the gauze mask on, my face did not heat up as earlier. </p><p>Two people by the road hopped on their motorcycle, caught up to me, </p><p>and recorded me with a camcorder before saying anything.</p><p>Are you making a documentary film?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020487_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I arrived in Zhangye at 7:00pm. I felt that Zhangye and Luoyang were quite alike. </p><p>The city gateway carried the name “GOLD Zhangye” by someone named Jiang. </p><p>It seemed that they had great expectation for this place.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020499_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were many hotels on streets. </p><p>My radar for finding hotels told me that today’s accommodation was the one on the fourth floor.</p><p>I lifted up 50 kg (Dido and bags) to the fourth without knowing why I wanted to stay here. </p><p>All I could say was that it was arranged by Heaven.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020505_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Single room: 50 RMB for one night.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out and asked for a cheaper room.</p><p>It turned out that there was a room accommodating four, 20 RMB each per night. </p><p>I was the only one checking in -- a room larger than a single room for 20 RMB.</p><p>That was not all! This room had a private toilet and shower with a shower head and 24 hour hot water.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020510_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Paying for the room, filling out phony guest information, taking off dirty clothes, I wanted a comfortable hot shower.</p><p>This was my second hot shower since I set out. The last time was 20 days ago. A hot shower had become a luxury.</p><p>For the sake of enjoying the luxury, I took my time and cleaned myself inch by inch.</p><p>I did not know when I was going to have a hot shower again.</p><p> </p><p>Dirty clothes always wash far cleaner with hot soapy water.</p><p>Even though the powder detergent I had was intended for use with cold water, it worked better in hot water.</p><p>The wash water was dirtier than mop water, as black as ink. I had been wearing such dirty clothes …</p><p> </p><p>I felt refreshed with a nice scent.</p><p>Another nice thing about staying in this hotel on the fourth floor was that there was an internet café on the third floor.</p><p>When finishing my travel log, I could kill time downstairs and did not need to look for internet café on the street.</p><p> </p><p>As I powered on my laptop, an unbelievable thing was happening.</p><p>It must be arranged by heaven, I received a wireless signal with encryption disabled in the hotel room.</p><p>With some uncertainty, I clicked “connect” and prayed in my mind.</p><p>SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTED! ! ! !</p><p> </p><p>I fixed myself a simple dinner of sweet hot brown sugar water and egg yolk cookies.</p><p>I was low on food again. What was left was some brown sugar for one glass of brown sugar water, </p><p>one stick of hot dog, and one piece of brick flatbread.</p><p>The distance between towns or cities had become further and further. I’d better to stock up tomorrow for safety.</p><p> </p><p>Today: 20 RMB for a super large hotel room, hot shower, private toilet, and free internet.</p><p>I wanted to stay here for one more day, can I?</p><p><br /></p>
