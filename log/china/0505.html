										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-14_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">The road leaving Tongguan was so terrible that it made me wanted to cry. </span></p><p>Filled with broken down gravels and dirt, it was a torture whether it was going up hill or down hill.</p><p>A few kilometers later, the challenge of up hill climbing was finally over. </p><p>The road became nice and smooth and it was much easier on my feet.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010287_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Next, all I saw was Mount Hua mountain ridge. </p><p>Tourist hotels were everywhere with non-stop tour buses coming and going. </p><p>Mount Hua was really beautiful looking from the mountain foot.</p><p>I don’t know what I would see when I climb up to the top of hill.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010295_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010298_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The distance I had to ride today is not shorter than yesterday. </p><p>But without going up and down the hills, it is definitely easier to accomplish.</p><p>Except, here is the problem. Since I am riding westbound, the sun is in my face after 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon.</p><p>Even when I have UV400 extra strength sunglasses on, I can barely keep my eyes open for a few hours until the end of day.</p><p> </p><p>I finished all my dry goods, except the brick flatbread. </p><p>Every time when I eat one of these brick flatbread, my stomach would complaint. So I am saving them for emergency only.</p><p>After 9 o’clock in the morning, I saw a restaurant with white smoke. </p><p>The boss lady asked me what I want. </p><p>Looking at the long list of menu and then I saw a kid having rice noodle and it looked delicious. So I ordered the same.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010306_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And it was a right decision. It tasted really good. </p><p>It had a firm texture of rice noodle with broth, shredded seaweed, dried shrimp and top with cilantro. Excellent! </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010303_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because of the strong sunray, it made me want to buy a floral sun hat.</p><p>When I get to Xi’an, I must go shopping and find me a suitable sun hat.</p><p>Otherwise, I will become a dried squid by the time I get to Urumchi</p><p> </p><p>A big red watermelon cost 2 RMB for 1 kilogram. </p><p>I asked the owner to cut 4 kilograms of melon and enjoyed the melon while avoiding the heat.</p><p>I told the owner that I am from Beijing. </p><p>Not after a couple of sentences, the owner questioned, “You are not from Beijing!”</p><p>What? How do you know? Is my accent ready that bad?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010312_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had stir-fried noodle for lunch at a small restaurant. </p><p>The owner asked me what kind of noodle I want. Thin noodle or pulled noodle?</p><p>Without a doubt, pulled noodle please because it looked delicious.</p><p>But I waited for half hour for a dish of stir-fried pulled noodle.</p><p><br />I watched the owner kneeling the dough, cutting the dough into strips of 2 centimeters thick, </p><p>and then pulling them by hand one by one until they were as thick as a noodle.</p><p>He was really pulling one by one and then holding them in his hands and pulled. </p><p>And then, BAM! Slapped them on the table for the final touch. </p><p>Now you have one order of hand “pulled” noodle. </p><p> </p><p>Wow…I though pulled noodle was made by cutting the dough with knifes, not pulling one by one by hand.</p><p>The order that was just finished wasn’t even mine; it was someone else who has ordered before me. </p><p>I still had to wait for mine.</p><p>Every one of those orders was freshly made when the order was placed, so I waited for a long long time for my noodle.</p><p>Before the boss lady prepared my noodle, she asked me if I wanted it spicy and I said NO. </p><p>But she still cooked with red hot oil.</p><p>So of course, it was very spicy. My tong lost feelings after just two bites. </p><p>Finally I finished the entire noodle by drinking a lot of tea. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010316_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sun was very strong and there were no shade for me to hide. </p><p>Once in a while I could hide under an overpass.</p><p>Looked at the blazing sun, it was only beginning of May and the temperature was already this hot. </p><p>I don’t know what would happen if I began my trip later.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010319_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The reason that I have been buying sugar popsicles was I thought these popsicles were only 0.50 RMB because they were sugar flavor. </p><p>That’s why they were cheap. Oh, was I wrong.</p><p>All flavored are 0.50 RBM, not just sugar flavor. </p><p>After I discovered this secret, I had 8 popsicles today. </p><p>They were sugar, cantaloupe, red bean, green bean, milk and strawberries flavor. </p><p>All 0.50 RBM each!</p><p> </p><p>Riding bike facing west, when I almost arrived at Xi’an, the road all the sudden became terrible. </p><p>After several of turns, finally I arrived at the super huge city – Xi’an.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010324_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Xi’an might be even bigger than Beijing.</p><p>It is really huge. It might be as big as Taipei and all the surrounding cities, which is the northern Taiwan. </p><p>But this is just a city.</p><p> </p><p>Even though the city is big and beautiful, the roads are very well structured, but the prices are suddenly went up sky high.</p><p>I checked a few “guest houses” along the way and there were over 100 RMB per night. </p><p>What? That’s ridiculous!</p><p>And when the staff told me the price, obviously they were thinking, </p><p>“Why do you even bother to ask the price? You can’t afford it!”</p><p> </p><p>Don’t you dare to look down at me like that! I really want to throw hundred dollar bills at her face. </p><p>But I shouldn’t waste money like that, so I continued to look for cheaper hotels.</p><p>Continued checking prices and moved toward the direction of the train station.</p><p>This is because in the next couple of days, I will take buses near the train station for sightseeing.</p><p>The closer I get to the train station, the more convenience it will be.</p><p>There are many hotels here, so I have to hurry up and check as many hotels as possible to find one that is in my budget.</p><p> </p><p>Found one with 40 RMB per night. It was a little expensive so I negotiated with the owner.</p><p>If I stayed for 3 nights, can I get a discount?</p><p>The owner said that they are almost booked so it is hard to give me a discount.</p><p>After negotiation, finally we agreed on 30 RMB per night for 3 nights. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010327_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After seen the room, I understood why it was 40 RMB. This was a nice double bed room.</p><p>It looks like I will have a good night sleep for the next three days….</p><p> </p><p>Tonight’s dinner was very casual. It was a couple of envelopes of Milo chocolate with brick flatbread broken into small pieces </p><p>and then mixed with hot water provided by the hotel, now I had home-made chocolate oatmeal. </p><p>After brick flatbread became nice of soft, finally I could eat it without getting upset stomach and it was very filling, too. </p><p> </p><p>It took me 13 days to get to Xi’an from Beijing.</p><p>From Beijing to Xi’an was my B2P warm up trip. The real challenge will start from Xi’an.</p><p>Now the warm up is over. The condition of equipment and Dido are very good. </p><p>My body is healthy. The extent of warm up is just right.</p><p> </p><p>I had a late night snack. The streets are still very busy at 10, 11 o’clock at night. Not like a ghost town at all.</p><p>I found a restaurant selling the “must try” lamb Bao Mo.</p><p>That was expensive! 12 RMB for one bowl. If it was with beef, then it was 9 RMB.</p><p>It was bun cut into very small pieces, mixed with very hot broth and top with slides of lamb. It also has cellophane noodle in the bowl. </p><p>Garnished with hot pepper sauce and vinegar pickled garlic which were perfect with lamb.</p><p>After soaking with broth, bao mo tasted very good.</p><p>I would recommend this dish, except it was expensive.</p><p>  </p><p>Tomorrow after waking up, I will visit terracotta solders. I was very excited and looking forward to it. </p><p>I asked the hotel owner for the direction. From where I stayed to the train station will only take 10 minutes by foot.</p><p>I can just take a bus. But the ticket for terracotta solders is very expensive. 90 RMB per ticket.</p><p>Plus other places, such as Qin Emperor’s Tomb. Hmmmm….how much money should I bring?</p><p><br /></p>
