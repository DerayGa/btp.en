										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-37_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Whenever possible, I think it is best if I rest before 19h00. </span></p><p>The tiresome feeling still haunts me from my previous ride till midnight. </p><p>The long hours of riding into midnight not only is physically and mentally draining, it also reduces my recovery for the next coupe of days. </p><p>Today is my second day resting at Dunhuan, the second I opened my eyes I felt like a lead weight, could barely get myself off the bed. </p><p>This is the price you pay for over riding. But I guess it is training in itself. </p><p>Perhaps on my next night ride my body wouldn’t react this severely.</p><p> </p><p>First mean of the day starts with beef noodle! I said to myself I wasn’t going to eat beef noodles unless I absolutely have to, </p><p>but the Lanzhou beef noodle is just to fine to pass on.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030426_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Have a great schedule planned for today. Off to Mt. Mingsa (screaming sand) for a camel ride </p><p>then to the famous Crescent Spring (a half moon shaped spring). </p><p>Since my hostel is well located, I just need to walk to the bus stop and catch a bus on Route 3, three minutes of walk. </p><p>The fare is cheap as well, 1RMB. Since Mt. Mingsa is closer to the city unlike Mogao Caves which is about 25km away.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030430_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The trip is only about 10 minute. Before we arrive, you could see the sand hill in the horizon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030432_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I have been riding forever looking for my dream desert and now it just appears.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030438_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since Crescent Spring is in Mt. Mingsa, you are only required a ticket for both. </p><p>And since this is not the tourist season, it’s will cost you 70 RMB. 100 RMB if it’s the tourist season.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030446_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After you pass the gate you are literally walking into the desert and the first thing to greet you is the heat wave. </p><p>Sand hills one after another. This is the real desert!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030448_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030453_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Unfortunately, ticket is just the start of your expenses here. </p><p>Now that you have paid your fee, how are you to enjoy the desert?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030451_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two choices, 1. Quad bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030535_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>2. Ride the camel.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030465_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And sorry, but no, you are not allowed to walk. That’s it. </p><p>I guess since you are already here, you might as well spend and enjoy yourselves.</p><p> </p><p>Camel rides have set routes and the price is set. You ride from the gate to Mr. Mingsa, </p><p>then to Crescent Spring and back to the gate, 60 RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030460_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This thing on the floor, camel dung. Not ok, camel dung. It smells like grass though.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030463_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Anyway, after I paid the ride fee, I am being called over to put on a shoe cover (to block out the sand). </p><p>They complained my feet are just too big; need to use a foreigner’s size. </p><p>After they carefully put on the shoe cover and tie up the laces and </p><p>I was really surprised by the service, the attendant now tells me this is an extra, another 10 RMB. Seriously?!!! </p><p>Only after you put the cover on then you tell me? Seriously?!!! </p><p>Now I am annoyed. This is not about money, but this is down right cheating. This is unethical by any business standard.</p><p> </p><p>Anyway, after you put on the cover you are ready to ride. </p><p>Don’t worry if you don’t know how to ride, there’s a guide leading the camel for you. </p><p>My guide’s name is Ning Sutai, from Qinghai. </p><p>He works as a guide during tourist seasons and stays at home with his children in off seasons.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030473_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I like Sutai, nice chap. When you travel on your own, </p><p>anyone who keeps me company and chat is always a thing to treasure. </p><p> </p><p>Generally they take out a whole tour group, camels are tied together, </p><p>you will see a small group of 5 ~6 camels of a bigger group of 10 ~ 20 camels. </p><p>Reminds me of the camel caravan that crossed the desert in the old days. </p><p>Camels shades off their firs once a year and right now, it’s shading time. All the camels looks as if they have skin diseases.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030489_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The camel is seated for you to climb on, hook into the stirrups and you hang tight onto the handle. </p><p>Still, every time the camel stands or sits, I always feel I am being thrown off.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030484_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The camel strolls onto the path with Sutai walking ahead. </p><p>This is a crappy job. In this heat Sutai has to walk the camel over the sand hills and I am his only customer. </p><p>Really, this isn’t easy. His monthly wage is only 300 RMB and he has to work all week. </p><p>The day starts at 05h00 (some customers are here to watch the sun rise) and ends only at 22h00 (sopme watches the sun set). </p><p>That’s a whopping 17 hours!!! Basically 10 RMB a day!!!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030500_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Without doubt, he survives by tips. Whilst strolling on top of the camel, </p><p>I went through my wallet to see what can I do for him. Grabbed 10 RMB for him first, before I have to spend on more “extras”. </p><p>10 RMB is really nothing. The ride is about 2 hours. Presume it’s tourist season and you have a full booking,you will do about 8 trips. </p><p>Apparently the tourists from Japan are the most generous, they tip by the hundreds. </p><p>But there are tourists who don’t bother to tip. They believe it is a service offered.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030506_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Luckily I am here on a Monday, not much tourists is here which is great. </p><p>Mt. Mingsa has a camel flock of about a thousand. </p><p>That’s a massive amount apparently during peak seasons you need more than a thousand camels just to cope.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030509_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Sutai called to me to loosen the grip on the handle and relax since I am wobbling all over the saddle. </p><p>Hey man, I am worried I would wobble off the camel, why do you think I am holding so tight. </p><p>Anyway, took his advise and hey, bouncing along with the camel’s steps, </p><p>way better, thanks! When I started I felt like a wannabe cowboy riding a bull machine, </p><p>waiting to see how long I can stay on. </p><p>Now I can balance and sit comfortably on my camel without holding the handle.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030515_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After we climbed a few sand dunes and strolled along the spines of a hill, we have arrived at Mt. Mingsa. </p><p>You can sand surf here. However, you had to climb up a steep hill first on your own two feet and it isn’t easy. </p><p>The sand is soft and you sink with every step. Very difficult to step off it. </p><p>What they did is they laddered the hill so you could climb up easier. </p><p>Easier my foot, the climb is about 30 storey, I am breathing like a camel now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030517_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When you eventually reach the top you will stacks of bamboo made box like “sand surfing boards”. </p><p>They charge you another 10 RMB for sand surfing. Since I already paid before the climb, I just need to show them my ticket.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030522_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The way down is rather steep, kept on reminding myself that I can’t scream, have to contain myself, need to act like a man.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030523_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And I worried for nothing, because the “box” barely moved! You had to literally dig in and push </p><p>as if you were paddling to move forward about 50cm and repeat. This is what I get for climbing this hill?!!!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030527_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Why would I need to paddle so hard to sand surf? Shouldn’t it be like “argh………………” and I get to the bottom of the hill? </p><p>The sand is so hot being under the sun all day and all of a sudden I felt </p><p>as if I am practicing an ancient Kung Fu technique where you continuously dig your hands into the a wok of burning sand.</p><p> </p><p>Thought I had it hard pushing myself all the ay down to the bottom and realized that the care taker on the bottom of the hill </p><p>when enough “boxes” are stacked, he had to carry them all the way to the top! Now that’s a hard job!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030533_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally I am back at the entrance of the sand surfing where Sutai is playing cards with other attendants whilst waiting for me. </p><p>I guess I will wait for him and rest a bit. The shoe cover looked to do its job, </p><p>but perhaps I worked too hard, sand get in my shoes anyway. Sand in my socks too. Sand everywhere.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030532_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If I knew this was going to happen I wouldn’t have bothered to rent this useless junk. </p><p>Rather that I tip Sutai. He has a kid in primary school in Qinghai and his parent is taking care of his son. </p><p>Sutai and his wife are all at Dunhuan working in the peak season. The family only gets together during winter.</p><p> </p><p>“Qinghai must be pretty, I want to visit sometime”. On my next trip,</p><p>I am bringing Misasa with and we will visit Qinghai &amp; Tibet. </p><p>Those are the two have to visit place for me in my live. I need to leave my footprint &amp; memories there.</p><p> </p><p>When I got here it was in the morning and it is already hot. </p><p>The afternoon will only get worse. I am tempted to visit the stalls selling cool drinks, </p><p>but the price triples to the price on the street is really bugging me. </p><p>Solution, “Sutai, would it be cheaper if you buy from the stalls? </p><p>If it is, wanna get us two cool drinks?”. If I buy it, it will cost me 6 RMB for one. </p><p>Sutai only paid 4 RMB for two. Tourists are meant to be ripped? Anyway, we are enjoying our cool drinks.</p><p> </p><p>From the sand paddling Mt. Mingsa back to the gate and then turn toward the Crescent Spring. </p><p>The Spring is a natural wonder. A half moon shaped spring in the middle of a desert. </p><p>It is breathtakingly beautiful and wonderous.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030552_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As expected, when it was discovered, it was abused to literally non-existent. </p><p>Only during the 80’s did they begin to maintain and rebuild the area. Technically, </p><p>the Spring we see today are not what it really were.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030570_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The Spring isn’t very big, the water is also shallow as if it would be dry in a couple of days. </p><p>But it is man maintained so it wouldn’t happen. </p><p>The site dug another man made spring to continuously supply water to the original spring </p><p>so the Crescent Spring can be here for our next generations to see.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030585_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The spring is surrounded with a vegetation the locals call it “seven star”. </p><p>Apparently it offers the same quality as the “little blue pill”. The locals also claimed a type of fish lives in it, they call it the “iron backs”. </p><p>Apparently it cures all sorts of diseases. Perhaps this is why the Crescent Spring almost disappears form the face of the earth. </p><p>Walked around the spring (it is now secured by a fence) and noticed there are actually fishes swimming. </p><p>Is this introduced or did it survived from time? Amazing.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030589_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sand at Mt. Mingsa are fine and a light brownish color. </p><p>The sand here by the spring is larger, crystal like and reflects the sunlight. </p><p>The locals called it “five coloured sand”. </p><p>The entrance is clearly marked with a “no container allowed” sign. For obvious reasons.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030563_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But tourists still took as much as they could with emptied cold drink bottles, </p><p>plastic bags and anything they can use. You would think the tourists could clean the desert out.</p><p> </p><p>The dunes surrounding the spring are so huge it is amazing that they have not covered the springs by now. </p><p>Using myself as a guideline, how huge are these dunes?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030566_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I asked Sutai to take this photo, but he continuously waved at me whilst I am trying to do the “Da Vinci man spread” </p><p>so I had to run back and check on him.</p><p>“you ran too far and I can barely see you.”,</p><p>“don’t worry, I am more interested in the desert, I am just a guide rule in the photo.”. </p><p>I then ran back 200m into the sand again.</p><p> </p><p>There are quite a few vegetations surrounding the spring, all grown out of the sand. </p><p>The book in the picture tells you the history of this particular tree.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030582_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Some are flowers, really amazing considering the environment they survive in.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030581_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A cute branch like sign reminding us to protect the environment.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030577_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Walking around the spring and appreciate its stunning view in all angles, </p><p>I am really happy I am here without tourists. Photos with true views of the spring and not with people in it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030590_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>We left the spring and strolled back to the gate on the camel around 12h00. </p><p>Lunchtime. I asked Sutai if he drinks and invited him to lunch for a cold one. </p><p>He suggested “donkey meat on yellow noodles” for lunch so off we went. </p><p>Enjoying my beer, I am really grateful for his services this morning. </p><p>10 RMB tip, a can of cold drink, a cold beer and a noodle dish. </p><p>My simple gestures to thank him and my endless appreciation for my friend form Qinghai. </p><p>Sutai had to get back to work after lunch and we bid farewell, I wondered would I see him again.</p><p> </p><p>Rested a little and stroll through the museum, no extra fees needed.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030435_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Initially I thought the museum is just there for more trinket stalls, but I was wrong. </p><p>This actually is a proper museum, which portrays the life of a wealthy family in ancient times.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030595_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>From the bedroom, atrium, kitchen and the study, it is all well kept. </p><p>There is also a history of Dunhuan. </p><p>I didn’t realize Dunhuan was sealed from China for 200 years from ancient times </p><p>when the emperor at the time closed Jiayuguan (a gate at the end of the Great Wall).</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030604_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For 200 years Dunhuan has been on its own. Since it is situated afar, </p><p>in terms of cultural and developments they are still different from China. But Dunhuan today is no longer a small abandoned town.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030607_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking at the excellent portraits of the famous people in the histories of Dunhuan and reading their deeds, </p><p>it vividly brought them back to live.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030599_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After I browsed through the museum, my tour today ends and I went back to the bus waiting for it to depart. </p><p>The driver however, kept himself busy trying to pick fruits of a tree by whacking it with a stick. </p><p>I went to check him out and noticed the dandelion seeds are ready to fly. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030613_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The driver finally finished his farm work and came back to the bus.</p><p>“apricot, try one?”, “of course!”. </p><p>Took a bite into the still green apricot and it is rather sour but very tasty.</p><p> </p><p>Today is my second day at Dunhuan, that haunting, tiring feeling finally disappeared in the afternoon.</p><p> </p><p>Did a quick count, I spent more than 500 RMB just two days in Dunhuan. </p><p>This is usually what I spend in about two weeks. </p><p>This is crazy, but I have tried to control it as well as I could. </p><p>Worried I won’t have enough cash for the coming journey, </p><p>I went to the cash machines to draw some cash, but the machine just would not accept my card. </p><p>To prevent carrying cash on my journey, </p><p>I specifically activated my facility to allow me to draw cash internationally and </p><p>that I can exchange on the day’s exchange rate. But if the cash machine don’t accept the card, this facility is useless.</p><p> </p><p>I really need the cash as I am running out. I need a bank that offers international facilities. </p><p>China has many banks, no less than Taiwan so I am trying a Bank of China. Sounds like it is a state owned Bank just like Bank of Taiwan. </p><p>Tried their cash machine and chose Chinese menu, didn’t work. </p><p>Tried again with English menu, the reddish RMB rolled out, excellent. </p><p>I have no idea why a bank would have a weigh in it. </p><p>But since it is there, I guess I will check my weight out. I have been traveling for about a month, </p><p>been eating gourmet meals but I haven’t put on any weight. The 100 plus kilometers of ride are taking care of the calories.</p><p> </p><p>Went to a rather noisy Dunhuan Night Market for dinner. </p><p>Found a local cuisine where they hand roll doles almost like a fish shape and stir fry it with eggplant and asparagus. </p><p>It is rather spicy, but not bad. The dole is small and slippery, spoon is a better option with this dish.</p><p> </p><p>I found barbecue corn on the side of the street. It’s sticky type of corn form the North East of China, </p><p>they boil it first before they barbecue it. The corn is soft by nature,</p><p>they barbecue it without any sauces so you get to taste the natural sweetness of the corn. 3 RMB for one.</p><p> </p><p>Since I am ahead of the schedule by two days (I planned to only arrive at Dunhuan today), </p><p>I can take it easy. Told the manager at the hostel that I am staying another day, </p><p>I have not finished with Dunhuan yet!</p><p><br /></p>
