Being there a second day, </span></p><p>I already felt like a regular. Today I ordered bean curd and decocted buns (6 for only 1 RMB).</p><p>The owner’s wife asked me if I wanted my bean curd sweet or salty. </p><p>I said “sweet” three times in a row, but all three times she heard me say salty.</p><p>So you can see how hard it is trying to communicate with an Henan accent ~_~</p><p> </p><p>I started riding today, but forgetting to fill all three water bottles, I’m riding without any water.</p><p>My plan was to ride 134 km west to Luoyang. </p><p>I thought I would make this distance by around 3pm, but who would have thought…I got lost again!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000953_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I did arrive at Luoyang after a 50 km detour, I was glad I finally made it.</p><p> </p><p>What happened was that on the way, I started to get thirsty around 9 am, </p><p>so I bought three catties of bananas - the cost was 6 RMB for 10+ bananas!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000955_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Maybe because I was born in the year of the monkey, those bananas were just right for me.</p><p>After having ten bananas one after the other, my thirst was finally stopped.</p><p> </p><p>I rode another 80 km along Route 310 still without water. There were some up and down hills on the way, but nothing too difficult.</p><p>After that I really got thirsty.</p><p>Not even bananas seem appealing any more, so I ran into the first grocery store in sight to get some beverages.</p><p> </p><p>I found a super size bottle of Sprite (2.5 lit), and this time it was really manufactured by the Coca-cola company.</p><p> </p><p>After filling up all three of my bottles with Sprite, I borrowed the freezer where they kept their ice cream to cool the Sprite. </p><p>Then I drank whatever was left in the 2.5 lit bottle. Without water I had Sprite; that doesn’t sound too bad, does it?</p><p> </p><p>While waiting for my Sprite to get cool, the sudden need of a sugar popsicle appeared, so I got two (5 cents each).</p><p>In the shade I enjoyed this rare moment of coolness.</p><p> </p><p>Putting the Sprite in my water bottles was what I thought was a good plan, </p><p>for not only could that save space, but also provide me with a supply of drinks for the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>But what happened was, all the carbonation was gone in half an hour, and what was left was only sugar water.</p><p>To add to that the coolness disappeared almost as soon as I put the bottles on my bike! Now all I had was this warm sugar water.</p><p>How does that sound for ‘not too bad’? ~_~</p><p>To make things worse the water bottles became sticky and gooey, and that took forever to clean.</p><p> </p><p>As I was moving steadily on Route 310, I was sure Luoyang was right in front of me, </p><p>but whenever I came to a crossroad I still couldn’t stop the urge to ask someone if I was on the right path.</p><p>Sure enough there was this bald man who told me that since I’m riding a bike it would be faster if I went another way.</p><p>He pointed toward a way different from the sign that said Luoyang, and I believed him.</p><p>Why take the long way when there’s a short one.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000967_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Actually the bald man was right, but I still got lost.</p><p>Before knowing it, I was in the mountains and climbing a hill again.</p><p>Although that way had my compass showing that I was going south when I should have been going west, </p><p>I thought that if I just kept on riding, eventually I'd come to the right road.</p><p>Then there were these young people who looked like free-wheeling riders, </p><p>who had flags on the back of their motorcycles.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000991-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I first saw them they were just resting in front of a store.</p><p>But when they saw me they got up and started their motorcycles, and soon they were all around me asking where I was heading.</p><p>I told them Luoyang, and asked if this road would lead me there.</p><p>They all laughed, because they just came from Luoyang.</p><p>Luoyang was in the opposite direction, and I had to turn back.</p><p>I was still reluctant to give up, so I asked if there was any chance that this road would lead to Luoyang.</p><p>The answer was NO, and I’d end up back in Zhengzhou if I kept on riding.</p><p>I felt like a great fool for getting lost once again.</p><p>So I turned back. Fortunately the way I came was all up hill, it didn’t take long for me to get back to a town.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000984_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The first thing in my mind was to get a stick of pineapple and ask which way would lead me to Luoyang.</p><p>The man said that the way I had just come was the way to Luoyang.</p><p>I'd have to turn back AGAIN. T_T</p><p>It felt as if I was riding the same road back and forth all day.</p><p>I found out because I rode too far down the hill, I'd have to climb back up again.</p><p>This should have been a short cut but it ended up to be an extra 50 km on my odometer.</p><p> </p><p>At last I got back on Route 310. Another 70 km and I’d be in Luoyang.</p><p>It was already 3pm by then and I was heading west into the sun.</p><p>The sun was right in my face, and this was definitely sun lotion time.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000996_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just before entering Luoyang, there was this really long tunnel of trees.</p><p>Riding through this endless green tunnel makes you feel as if you were on a treadmill, moving with no progress.</p><p>But that's just an illusion, and at about 6pm I finally arrived at the ancient city of Luoyang.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000998_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>First things first, I had to find somewhere to stay.</p><p>A pedestrian gave me a direction and I went to check it out.</p><p>It was the luxurious Luoyang Hotel.</p><p>Just to see how much it would cost for staying a night, the clerk said 200~300 RMB. I got out of there as soon as I could.</p><p> </p><p>While looking for some other place to stay, I met an old lady with her bicycle.</p><p>There was this Persian dog (a Persian cat-like dog) in the basket of the bike.</p><p>She came up to me and asked: “Where are you heading?” as if we were old friends.</p><p>She didn’t ask me all the questions I got so tired answering, but cut right to the core.</p><p>I said I was looking for a cheap place to stay.</p><p>And thanks to this old lady I found Xin Xin Hotel.</p><p> </p><p>Just while I was about to carry my bike up to the second floor to ask about the price, </p><p>there was a girl at the door talking on her cell phone in Cantonese.</p><p>Seeing me coming in, she ended her phone call in a hurry and asked me if I was looking for a room. I said yes, and asked how much it would be.</p><p>‘There are more expensive rooms and cheaper ones, which would you like?’ she said.</p><p>I said I wanted the cheapest.</p><p> </p><p>What I got was a room with only a bed and a trash can for 20 RMB a night.</p><p>I was two days ahead of schedule so I planned to spend an extra day in Luoyang sight-seeing, </p><p>and for staying two nights it was 5 RMB off, so it only cost me 15 RMB for the second night.</p><p> </p><p>For dinner I had the pack of instant noodles I bought from Mario the first day.</p><p>After riding ten days with it in my sack, it felt great to finally get rid of it.</p><p>Now I could get something new to keep as supply.</p><p> </p><p>The need for tissue was greater then I had expected.</p><p>I had been picking up a piece here and there in restaurants and hotels along the way, but that wouldn’t do.</p><p>So I went to the grocery store and got a whole roll for 1 RMB.</p><p>Now I could finally blow my nose whenever I needed to without worrying about needing to use the same piece again. XD</p><p> </p><p>When I went to wash my clothes and get a shower, I met a young man who was also traveling. </p><p>He had already gone through half of China.</p><p>After asking him for information, I decided to go to old Luoyang and the White Horse Temple the next day.</p><p>That should be fun～*^^*</p><p> </p><p>The people at the hotel said that Luoyang was a pretty big city and advised me to get a map of the city.</p><p>Actually after getting lost today, once I leave the hotel I’m a little afraid that I might not be able to find my way back.</p><p> </p><p>After riding 180 km today, I guess I deserved a break!!</p><p>After all, how often does a man get to come to Luoyang?</p><p><br /></p>
