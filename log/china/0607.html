There was nothing grown on it, though, no wonder it's called Flaming Mountains.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040687_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Enjoying the view, I effortlessly passed this entrance of the "Red Mountain", which was famous with its windy weather. </p><p>I thought I was pretty lucky today.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040700_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>You can see lots of watermelons, Hami melons and raisins on sale along the way to Turpan.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040641_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040720_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Hmmmm…. I wondered what are these mud-structured THINGs? </p><p>Tens of thousands of them built in such a barren area. </p><p>(Note by the translator: These weird structures are used to air-dry grapes to make raisins)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040644_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, I had already seen the best part of Flaming Mountains. No need to spend money for the tour again, I guess.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040711_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I arrived at Turpan City at noon, much earlier than I expected. It is only 180 km away from Urumqi at this point.</p><p>Originally I thought it would take me two days from Turpan to Urumqi. </p><p>Since I was ahead of the schedule, I could bike a bit further this afternoon, so I can definitely enter Urumqi by tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>I had my lunch at the truck rest area before entering Turpan. </p><p>I really loved the Islamic food, and I ordered a stir-fried noodle and a meatball soup, Islamic style, both were exquisite. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040721_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After resting for half an hour, I took off again.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040727_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040728_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>"Welcome to Turpan", my destination for today. Time to look for a hotel?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040730_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Turpan is also famous for its vine yard. Most grapes were small but seemed ripe, ready to make wine.</p><p>There is a vine yard opened to tourists, rated four stars in China.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040737_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was a wonderful idea to take advantage of the trellis-climbing grapes. </p><p>Not only they were beautiful to look at, they also provided an excellent shade. </p><p>Most importantly, fruitful grapes were growing as great as they can be.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040739-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Five-cent ice cream! Tasted like watermelon flavor, very yummy.</p><p>The boss was a Uyghur, so I said "Lah-huh-may-teh"(meaning "Thank you") to show my appreciation to his ice cream in this hot hot day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040741_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Wandering in the urban area until 3:30, I decided to continue on Rt 312. </p><p>My plan was to move another 20-30 km, to make tomorrow an even easier ride.</p><p> </p><p>BUT…</p><p>I did not take it serious about the windy situation from Turpan to Urumqi, </p><p>especially the famous 30 km that was VERY windy, up to Force 12.</p><p>Before I entered the famous windy area, I did see the sign "No Bicycle". </p><p>As you can imagine, of course I totally ignored it. </p><p>Didn't you see me ride my Dido on every highway so far? What made this different from rest of the highways in China?</p><p> </p><p>Well, let me tell you why. It is IMPOSSIBLE to ride a bike on this part of the National Highway.</p><p>Luckily, I got through the first 4 km by hiding behind a tricycle carrying piles of stuff.</p><p>After that, I was on my own.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040747_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Struggling, I managed to ride the bike little by little, but wobbling very badly at the same time. </p><p>Because there was no shoulder, and I was not able to steer my bike as I normally do. </p><p>I had to occupy the whole lane of the highway.</p><p>All the cars passed me dared NOT to honk, either. They just tried their best to pass by me safely. </p><p>I guessed they were very sacred of bumping me, or got bumped by me.</p><p> </p><p>After officially entering the windy area, I could not even maintain my balance on the bike. </p><p>This got to be the strongest wind I had ever encountered in my whole life. </p><p>Compare to this, the Typhoons we had in Taiwan were just a piece of cake.</p><p>At the beginning, I was very excited and yelling, </p><p>"Come! Come! Let me see what else can you do?" </p><p> </p><p>Around 5:00 in the afternoon, I knew there was no way I can continue to ride on the bike. </p><p>I WALKED with my bike instead. But even that was extremely difficult, </p><p>with wind came in from all directions except the one that can make my life easier. </p><p>After a while, I can't even walk with my bike. I had to lean on Dido with my waist and right foot, </p><p>and my left foot standing like a tilted A-shape with my body. </p><p>And this wired gesture could merely allow me to STAND with Dido in the wind. </p><p>How could I move forward, then?</p><p> </p><p>This wind was not only fast and strong, but also very dry. I constantly had tears in my eyes. </p><p>My saliva was blown out of my mouth anytime I opened my mouth.</p><p>Just when I thought I had the worst wind ever,</p><p>I kept encountering the stronger and stronger wind every inch I move forward.</p><p>I lowered my head while walking with Dido, the wind blew away my sun glasses within 1/10 sec,and it fell on the ground within half a sec.</p><p>Of course I would want to get it back since it was the only pair of sun glasses </p><p>with corrected vision I had with me. But there was just no chance at all that I could do it. </p><p>I had to watch my sun glasses "gone with the wind" for the next 3 sec. </p><p>It rolled on the graveled road, downhill a bit, crossed to the other side of the road, and then disappeared, just like that, in front of me.</p><p> </p><p>I started feeling scared by now. If the wind can take away my glasses on my head, </p><p>and I had to struggle so badly just to keep Dido by my side standing. Can I really walk this part through?</p><p>With no option, I told Dido," Don't worry. We will get through this together".</p><p> </p><p>It took me 30 min to advance less than 1 km. </p><p>I even felt my clothes were going to torn apart by the wind,</p><p>like the man in the Aesop's Fable, "The Wind and the Sun", when he was facing the Wind's challenge.</p><p>I planned to walk like this until 9:00, if the situation was not improving and I could not find a place to stay, </p><p>I would hide into some area under the bridges for a night.</p><p> </p><p>I didn't try to hitchhike, I just continue walked with Dido.</p><p>Honestly, with wind blowing like this, I couldn't move much at all if without Dido, I probably could not even stand still for more than 3 sec. </p><p>Leaning on Dido actually helped me lower my barycenter, also added the weight on me. </p><p>So even the progress was very slow, at least I was making some.</p><p>I told myself that I would not ask for help, I would not hitchhike at any point. I can make it, I really can.</p><p> </p><p>So, here I was, walking like this, from 5-9. My hands were so sore by holding the bike very tightly in the wind.</p><p>It reminded me the time when I was in the military service training. </p><p>I was a MP (Military Police), and sometimes serviced in the motorcycle escort group. </p><p>Before we can proudly ride on this 1300c.c. motorcycle, we had to be able to run with it (not ON it),like the way I was walking with Dido.</p><p>Yamaha Royal-star was the motorcycle on the force at that time. </p><p>It weights 347 kg with the empty tank, so you can imagine how exhausted it was to run with this monster.</p><p>Well, now please move the camera back to ME walking (barely) with my Dido, </p><p>which weighted over 50 kg with all the bags but felt like heavier than that Yamaha Royal-star, against a windy weather like this. </p><p>No wonder the sign said, "No Bicycle". However, even if I was well aware of this windy situation, </p><p>I would still come up to face this challenge.</p><p> </p><p>After 9, still no sign of any city/town, I was starting to look for a place to crash for tonight.</p><p>I looked around with my eyes filled with tears—by the wind, and I saw a truck parked around 200 meters away from me.</p><p>I knew, right at that moment, he was sent to save my life.</p><p> </p><p>Although it was only 200 m away, it took me and Dido about 5 min to get there.</p><p>The driver looked pretty young, </p><p>"You have such an impeccable timing. Today is one of the worst days on this road. Come on now", he said.</p><p>We were 1 meter apart, but we had to yell to each other.</p><p>As if the words we said were blown away by this wind as soon as they left our mouth.</p><p>I stood by the truck and asked if there was any place to spend the night around here.</p><p>"Not within 10 km."</p><p>"Will the wind become gentler if I continue on this road?"</p><p>"It will only get worse. The wind will blow at you from the side or against you. It is impossible to pass that, if you walk with the bike"</p><p>Well, I got my answers, I surrendered—for now. I loaded all the bags into the truck, then the Dido.</p><p>The driver asked me where I was heading, I said "Urumqi". </p><p>"I was riding ON my bike since day one of this trip, and I am very proud of it. </p><p>I wouldn't get into your car if not for this windy situation. I really appreciate your kindness, but I really wish I can overcome this by myself".</p><p>His name is Baisong Chiang. He carried a truck full of watermelons from Turpan to sell at Urumqi, so he offered to give me a ride to Urumqi.</p><p>"How long can we arrive at Dabancheng? I think I can ride from there to Urumqi myself".</p><p>"It is also very windy from Dabancheng to Urumqi. What if you got stuck there again? Why not let me take you all the way to Urumqi".</p><p>Baisong was younger than me by 2 years. He has already married and with a baby.</p><p>I was very happy for him when he talked about his kid.</p><p>Sitting inside the truck, which was also greatly affected by the wind, I saw the beautiful sight through the window, </p><p>feeling very disappointed that I was not able to bike Dido through this part of my journey.</p><p> </p><p>Baisong is an interesting person, and he likes to have his freedom, just like me. He was from Henan province, </p><p>but he left home to Turpan to be independent by the age of 15. </p><p>He didn't like to work for others, so he learned to open his own business. </p><p>Baisong doesn't make a lot of money, but he gets to work for himself, and manages to support his own family. </p><p>Other than transporting melons, he also grows Hami melons with some farmers. </p><p>They calculate the time so that when the melons are ready for fall harvest, </p><p>which is around mid August, their Hami melons would be the only ones available on the market in China. </p><p>These melons are sent to Beijing to sell and make extra 70-80,000 RMB for each of them.</p><p>When we passed the tollbooth, I asked Baisong if I can pay for the toll. </p><p>He said it was not a big deal at all. We are friends, and that's what friends are for.</p><p>I mentioned Dabancheng earlier, so Baisong detoured to show me the city. </p><p>He said, because of the famous folks song, "The girls from Dabancheng", </p><p>everybody wants to come here to visit this city at least once in his life time, but,</p><p>"You will regret for the rest of your life if you never get a chance to visit. </p><p>But after you visit, you will regret for the rest of your life that you ever get a chance to visit".</p><p>However, I still asked Baisong to drop me off here. </p><p>Maybe the road ahead is as difficult as he said, but I wanted to give it another try. I wanted to BIKE to Urumqi by myself.</p><p> </p><p>I really appreciated Baisong's kindness and help, so that I did not have to sleep under some bridge of some sort. </p><p>There is nothing I can say to express my gratitude, especially his "That's what friends are for"; I will always remember that, Baisong. Thank you.</p><p>After around 50 km later, we arrived at Dabancheng at 10:00 at night. </p><p>The first thing was to look for a place to sleep, and I found one with 8 RMB a night. </p><p>The lady said it was raining at Urumqi, that's why on the way to Dabancheng was having such a big storm. </p><p>She wondered what the weather would be like tomorrow.</p><p>The boss, on the other hand, was pretty drunk already. </p><p>He kept threatening me that he would call police to arrest me if I can't show him my ID. </p><p>I asked him to go to sleep early and I will have some drink with him tomorrow.</p><p>The 8 RMB room was not too bad, except it was a bit far away from bathroom and water fountain.</p><p>The second thing on my list was, dinner.</p><p>I found a BBQ restaurant nearby. Like everybody else here, I also ordered a yogurt-like drink, </p><p>it was called "sour milk" in Chinese, but it was not sour at all. Added some sugar, it tasted pretty good, actually.</p><p>Then the real food was here, BBQ meat and cold beer. I was having time of my life.</p><p>Right there, I told myself, if the weather is bad tomorrow, I shall stay in Dabancheng for one more day. </p><p>If the weather is really good tomorrow, I shall also stay in Dabancheng for one more day.</p><p>My philosophy is: I will have great moments to remember this trip by if I take it slow once a while when the "place" is right. </p><p>Otherwise, all I can talk about when I am old will be how many miles I accumulated everyday on my GPS tracker in this whole entire trip. </p><p>What's the point then?</p><p><br /></p>
