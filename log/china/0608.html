										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-48_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">It was bliss to stay in the cool town of Dabancheng one more day.</span></p><p>The city guide said that the town was very accessible, 90 km away from either Urumqi or Turpan</p><p>(Note: Urumqi is also known as Urumchi, or Ürümchi)</p><p>Is it very accessible if a place is 90 km from its adjacent cities? </p><p>Because of the “accessibility”, Danbancheng had become a quiet place and a nice summer retreat.</p><p>A bowel of shaozi noodles was my initial order at my breakfast restaurant. </p><p>Then I saw some yummy-looking flatbread on the next table, and ordered that as well.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040776_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was a green onion pancake with a side dish of lightly seasoned julienne cucumber, julienne daikon and sliced onion. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040774_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since the milk tea they offered was not Tibetan yak butter tea, I skipped it.</p><p>I reconfirmed my route to Urumqi with the cook in the breakfast restaurant and made sure that I could ride through.</p><p>“On the whole, it is not an easy ride. It is not as bad as the famous 『30 km wind gap』 though, </p><p>you should be able to make it if you do it in the morning when the wind has not picked up”</p><p> </p><p>The market place had been very busy in the morning and seemed to remain busy for the rest of the day – I would check it out later then.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040780_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Milk calves were traded in the market. A sold calf was dragged away from the old owner. </p><p>Apparently she did not want to leave the old owner.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040782_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then, I went back to the guest house and walked Dido out. </p><p>The guest house had only a small signboard outside. However, it had a spacious court yard inside and my room was in the corner. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040895_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were many broad bean stores in Dabancheng. Broad beans are a local specialty of Dabancheng.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040790_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dabancheng also had vast precious grassland where animals were grazing, and produced a large quantity of milk. </p><p>It was very different than the surrounding barren mountains.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040832_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Therefore, you can understand that milk tea and yogurt are sold at the stores here. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040822_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Luckily, today was Friday when the weekly market was held with a variety of vendors. I happily enjoyed the busy thriving market.</p><p>At 2:00pm, I started touring Dabancheng on Dido and first rode toward an attraction spot, the old town.</p><p>Grassland – long time no see! The rapeseed flowers were waving in the wind.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040809_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The same raging wind like yesterday was at my back today and blew me forward.</p><p>I did not need to push the pedals but controlled the handlebar and the brake.</p><p>The trees bent in the wind. Which mountain did the gale come from?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040795_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The old town was not far – 10 minutes ride. I just wanted to take a look at the old town at the gate. </p><p>Since the entrance fee was inexpensive and bicycles were allowed, I paid for the ticket and took the tour.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040836_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040842_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040887_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dabancheng was built a thousand years ago dating back to the Tang dynasty. </p><p>Everything was either damaged during the war, or lost with the passing of time, except for its city wall.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040848_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This old town was actually the carefully renovated White Water town located outside of Dabancheng.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040850_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040851_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Only a few houses were in the little old town, but each one had its own character, with souvenirs and local specialties for sale. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040854_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040857_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As the matter of fact, I never heard the famous song “The Dabancheng Girl” before. </p><p>Even with the lyrics and score in front of me, I did not know how to sing it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040861_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While I was trying to sing the song, the winery owner invited me over. </p><p>I had a glass of red wine which had very low alcohol content and tasted like grape juice – not bad though.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040863_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040866_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>By the way, I asked the owner to play “The Dabancheng Girl” for me.</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Wang Luobin collected and revised this folk song of Uygur. Here are the lyrics:</p><p>“Dabancheng’s stone roads are hard and smooth</p><p>Water melons are big and sweet </p><p>The girls live there having long braids and beautiful eyes.</p><p>If you want to get married, don’t marry other man.</p><p>You must marry me</p><p>Bring your million dollar dowry and take your young sister with you</p><p>Come to me in a carriage”</p><p>Accompanied by guitar, this is a happy folk song. </p><p>It sounded funny the first time I listened to it, but it lightened my heart after several replays.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040868_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dido was left with the winery owner and the staff of the Wang Luobin memorial hall </p><p>as I was browsing through the memorial hall to learn who Wang Luobin was.</p><p>Thanks to him who revised so many Xinjiang folk songs, we are left with lots of good songs including the famous “The Dabancheng Girl”.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040870_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I told the winery owner that I never heard the song and asked him to play it for me, </p><p>he was shocked – how could it be possible not to have heard it as a Chinese?</p><p> </p><p>The lyrics say water melons are big and sweet in Dabancheng, Dabancheng does not grow them.</p><p>Broad beans are the major agricultural product here. </p><p>They are processed and made into snacks with various flavors such as garlic, spicy, strawberry or fruit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040873_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The old town has a broad bean shop as well.</p><p>Just like Harry Potter’s Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, there were various flavored broad beans sold here and there was one named “strange flavor”. </p><p>I asked the lady owner if it was for real before sampling it with my eyes closed.</p><p>It tasted like BBQ lamb kabob and the flavor was not strange at all.</p><p>I bought a small bag of fruit flavored beans - crispy, tasty and nutritious.</p><p> </p><p>After thousands of years, only the city wall ruin was left. </p><p>The ruin was not protected by anything, but enclosed with rope.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040882_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Perhaps the town would be gone forever in a thousand years, </p><p>or some unbelievable technology would rebuild the town. Who knows?</p><p> </p><p>There were a few real tents, plank wood trails with weeds sticking out from the joints and a spring named “bringing baby”.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040881_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The cold, gusty wind ruffled my hair. My hair had grown long during the trip and was getting harder to deal with.</p><p>I would get a buzz cut after getting back to Dabancheng.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040890_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I dropped in the hair saloon next door to my guest house and had the hairdresser cut my hair without asking the price.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040897_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had a hair wash first, then I was asked about hairstyle.</p><p>“buzz cut, but don’t shave me bald”</p><p>10 minutes later, my haircut was done. I felt fresh and delightful when touching the short hair.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040900_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>During the haircut, I chatted with the local hairdresser. It turned out that the locals do not eat broad beans.</p><p>Then, who would eat them?</p><p>It turns out that the broad beans were not sold for the locals, but for whom then?</p><p>“For You!” said the hairdresser with laugh on her face.</p><p>She said that Dabancheng was a boring place with nothing to do </p><p>and people did not make much money and had no place to spend it either.</p><p>Isn’t that good? Don’t worry about having no money, because there is no place to spend it.</p><p> </p><p>Wearing my new hairstyle, I went to the market place before it was closed. </p><p>The weekly market place was busy and surely an event for Dabancheng.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040902_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I bought a big bag of cracker-like puffs - one RMB only. </p><p>“What they are?” I asked</p><p>“Popcorn!” said the owner.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040909_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>What? They were popcorns! Shouldn’t the popcorn flakes are white in ball-shape?</p><p>Never mind, even if they were not “popcorn”, I had nothing to lose. </p><p>Slightly sweetened popcorn on the go - I shared them with the cute little kids in the market.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040918_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Clothes, hardware and groceries were not what I needed, what interested me always was food.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040921_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Here is some deep-fried cake with sugar paste filling – sweet and yummy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040924_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The kid with the deep-fried cake stall surprised me greatly.</p><p>“Uncle, are you traveling on bicycle?” he burst out.</p><p>Wow, very clever! How did you know? Did I bump into you on the road?</p><p>The smart kid saw the tan lines around my fingers to figure out that I was traveling on bike.</p><p>“You go, smart kid. One day you will be somebody”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040907_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Please take a look! They are some cute Dabancheng girls having long braids and beautiful eyes – super kawaii.</p><p>[Note: kawaii is Japanese means cute]</p><p>~girls, I am sharing my popcorn with you~</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040930_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though Dabancheng does not grow water melons, it was quite an experience to eat a water melon there.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040904_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The watermelon man was a Uyghur, his melons were super cheap. </p><p>The most expensive watermelon I ever had was in Xian – 3 RMB for one Chinese pound (or 500 g).</p><p>The most inexpensive watermelon was in Dabancheng – 2.5 RMB for one melon (2.5 kg), one sixth of the Xian price.</p><p>The watermelons from Turpan have fewer seeds than the melons in Xian. </p><p>They are super sweet and have dark green rind with no jagged stripes</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040940_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>He carefully picked a melon of the right size for one person. </p><p>I was watching the crowds in the busy market while enjoying the sweet melon.</p><p> </p><p>Some strange looking vegetables were sold at the market, </p><p>such as super large purple onions, greenish daikons, purplish daikons, and large green chili peppers which were seen in every dish.</p><p>I thought the chili pepper was a bell pepper, so I bit down. Man, it was super hot!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040931_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dinner was braised beef over rice at the restaurant in the market. Chinese food was delicious and was my kind of food.</p><p>Moreover, Chinese food and Taiwanese food are quite alike. Even being out in China for more than forty days, </p><p>I did not miss Taiwanese food to the degree that I could not sleep but looked forward to some new delicacy every day. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040945_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had a great time in Dabancheng today, eating good food and seeing beautiful scenery. </p><p>Tomorrow morning I would manage to get up early and be off to Urumqi before the wind started picking up.</p><p><br /></p>
