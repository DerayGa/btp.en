there's no way I can teach you that."</p><p><br />Whatever has changed me has happened bit by bit. </p><p>Like my tanned fingers, day by day you only see a little difference, </p><p>or like the 3mm of GPS readings I get everyday, and wondering when it will ever get to Paris.</p><p>But now my hands look like the face of a joker, and the 3mm lines have cut through China.</p><p>I look in the mirror and see the changes on the outside: like my hair grew, and then was cut in Dawanching, </p><p>but what doesn't show in the mirror is what has changed inside me.</p><p> </p><p>I had never though that these travel notes I wrote on the bedside before falling asleep would have had such a great echo of response.</p><p>Whenever I hear that someone, after reading my notes,has got on a bike that they haven't ridden for decades,</p><p>I truly thank these people for not just turning off their computers after a few laughs,</p><p>and for taking a role in Bike To Protect Our Planet..</p><p> </p><p>There are those who say that I'm just using global warming as a slogan for riding, </p><p>especially because I don't really talk about it a lot in my notes.</p><p>But frankly speaking, does it really make any difference in global warming </p><p>if I ride from Beijing to Paris, or perhaps around the world?</p><p>The answer is NO!</p><p>There's no use just having a slogan; it's the actions that count.</p><p>Thanks for all those who support Bike To Protect Our Planet..</p><p>Because of you, we can really make a difference.</p><p>The problems of global warming are what we all should care about, </p><p>because we all live on the same planet, and can rely only on one another.</p><p> </p><p>There's No Hero Here ( that's what I named my first travel notes),and I'll say that again when I arrive in Paris.</p><p>For all those who are willing to practice and promote this idea, </p><p>you are the heroes,because it is you who are the ones protecting our planet.</p><p> </p><p>Ridding a bike is only one thing, but saving energy is what really matters.</p><p>Daily stuff, like recycling, turning lights off before leaving a room, </p><p>using mass transportation and cutting down on the use of air conditioning.</p><p>This we all know, but whether we do it or not is another question.</p><p> </p><p>I trust you all will do so, right?</p><p> </p><p>There are still four more months of traveling in front of me. </p><p>Although I don't know what will happen tomorrow,</p><p>I'm sure I'll enjoy every bit of it.</p><p><br />I'll keep on sharing my notes and pictures whenever I can.</p><p>Thanks for all of your encouragement.</p><p>This cheers me on, and I know that I'm never alone.</p><p><br />I shall arrive in Paris, no matter how long it takes. I'll be there.</p><p>Under the Eiffel Tower, I shall wave the flag of BTP and the flag of Taiwan.</p><p>That will be the moment I'll like to share in tears or laughter with all of you.</p><p><br />You do believe I'll get there, don't you?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060421_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><br /></p>
