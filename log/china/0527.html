										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-36_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Stumbling back to the guest house like a drunken dad out of a party, </span></p><p>I felt very tired and sleepy but still remembered to take a shower before dropping onto the bed.</p><p>Chores like writing up my travel log and washing clothes were left behind. I could not keep my eyes open…</p><p>Waking up naturally before 9:00am, it was not too late. It felt great to get enough sleep.</p><p>Breakfast was a cup of hot brown sugar water. </p><p>I started washing dirty clothes and line-dried them on the multi-purpose rope stretching from the headboard to the window sill.</p><p>With the hot sun and very dry weather, clothes did not take long to dry. I did not even bother squeezing the water out.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030284_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then I started working on the travel log for yesterday’s night ride which was quite exhausting. Why did I push on without a cause?</p><p>I went for a walk after the remaining chores had been finished.</p><p>“Dunhuang Night Market” where I drank last night became “Oasis Market” by day. Anything could be bought there, you name it.</p><p>The picture shows a stall owner making chili powder.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030294_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>All the stalls selling dry fruit at the pedestrian-only area were alike with not only the same products for sale but also the same stall setup.</p><p>Dried fruit is my favorite – Oh! well, I am from Yilan!</p><p>[Note: Yilan, Taiwan is famous for its dried fruit]</p><p>You could sample anything shown in the picture. One was not enough? </p><p>get a second one, and don’t forget to make comments:</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030302_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>“Not sweet, tasteless” </p><p>“Not pitted – not for me”</p><p>“Need peeling – troublesome”</p><p>Without the comments, the stall owner would automatically bag the one that you just sampled for you.</p><p>There were several goodies. I bought ice plums, almond inside apricots and pearl tomatoes. </p><p>Everything cost either 10 or 12 RMB a Chinese pound – not expensive.</p><p>I grabbed two tasty, but a bit expensive, goodies after paying up, but forgot my bags of dry fruits at the stall.</p><p>Later on, I sensed that I paid for something but my hand was empty – very forgetful.</p><p> </p><p>Lunch was at the “Oasis Market”. There were lots of restaurants offering a variety of different cuisines.</p><p>I liked to try the local specialty, so I went to a packed small restaurant and ordered a Dunhuang latiaozi.</p><p>[Note: latiaozi is a noodle; the dough was cut in pieces and then pulled long before being cooked]</p><p>Noodles and sauce are served separately, mix it up yourself.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030305_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The noodles were hand-made, nice and chewy, </p><p>and the sauce was made of a variety of vegetables such as egg plants, winter melons, bell peppers, tomatoes and chili peppers.</p><p>The mixed noodle was yummy and the mild spicy sauce stimulated the appetite.</p><p> </p><p>In the afternoon, I was headed for the most notable attraction in Dunhuang, </p><p>Mogao Caves which was included in the UNESCO world heritage list in 1987.</p><p>[Note: Mogao Caves is also known as Mogao Grottoes or Mogao Ku]</p><p>I asked the guest house staff how to get there by public bus, since it was 25 km from the downtown Dunhuang. </p><p>Taking a taxi would definitely be a rip off!</p><p>My guest house was in a great location, a night market was right in front of it, </p><p>the Dunhuang museum and the Dunhuang theatre were right next to it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030289_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And it was only 3 minutes walk to the public bus stop</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030309_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The buses run every 20 minutes - bus fare: 8 RMB - ride time: 30 minutes.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030409_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was back on the road where I night biked alone last night in the bus. I was glad that it was all over.</p><p> </p><p>Ready for the ticket price for Mogao Cave?</p><p>Prequel – the admission fee for other attractions.</p><p>Yellow River: 30 RMB</p><p>Jiayu Pass: 60 RMB</p><p>Emperor Qin’s Terra-Cotta Warriors and Horses Museum: 90 RMB</p><p>Take a guess – how much is the ticket price for Mogao Caves?</p><p><br />Ready?</p><p>I asked an ice pop hawker for the ticket price before coming and was totally shocked.</p><p>When handing over the money, 160 RMB, my heart was not bleeding too terribly – it was at least well-prepared.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030325_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Summer is the high season, so the ticket price is raised to 160 RMB for Chinese and 180 RMB for foreign visitors.</p><p>Winter is the low season, half price - 80 RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030335_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Beverages were even more expensive, the 2.5 RMB cola was sold for 6 RMB, </p><p>the 1 RMB water was sold for 5 RMB, and the 0.5 RMB ice pops were sold for 2 RMB.</p><p>Every time I learned a new price, 100 CC of blood were lost. Finally, I did not buy anything.</p><p> </p><p>Stupas were scattered at the entrance, I do not know when they were built. </p><p>They did not seem to be precious; otherwise they won’t be just placed here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030326_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had my camera and notebook ready to visit and record the great statues and murals, </p><p>but photography, recording, cigarettes and backpacks were strictly forbidden. </p><p>Checking in my bag and camera at the gate, I got in and lined up. Staff would divide visitors into small groups.</p><p>Each group with about ten people was assigned a tour guide from Dunhuang Research Institute. Each tour was about 2 hours long.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030333_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are more than four hundred caves and every one is locked. </p><p>They are unlocked only if the visitors are accompanied by tour guides.</p><p>No lighting inside the cave, the guide carries a yellow flashlight and the visitors follow the light pointing at the wall with the explanation.</p><p>When a cave tour is finished, the guide will lock the door if no group is waiting outside.</p><p>They did a very good job of preserving the caves with respect to the visitors.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030340_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are more than four hundred caves, of which you will see only ten caves open to public on the short tour.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030346_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Mogao Cave is a shrine of Buddhist art treasures, the caves construction and maintenance spanned several dynasties.</p><p>Each new dynasty would cover the walls with clay and paint new murals.</p><p>The floor tiles were also layered by one dynasty after another over thousand of years. </p><p>The caves had become a collection of art interactions of the ancient dynasties.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030347_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It’s a pity that I could not take any pictures. However, I did learn many interesting things from the guide.</p><p>The American art thief, Langdon Warner, who used chemicals and tapes to remove twenty six murals, was always mentioned by the guides.</p><p>However, only eleven wall paintings were restored. The rest of them disappeared from art history forever.</p><p> </p><p>The library cave used to store fifty thousand precious manuscripts sealed off thousand years ago </p><p>was eventually rediscovered during the international "Joint Army of the Eight Powers". </p><p>During war time, nobody cared about what had been found in a little town in the far northwest reaches of China.</p><p>The discovery brought archaeologists from Japan, France, Russia and elsewhere flooding into Dunhuang and they promptly emptied the cave. </p><p>They stole or purchased by deceit more than eighty percent of precious manuscripts which ended up in foreign counties. </p><p>What had left were only incomplete fragments. However, the discovery of the library cave cultivated the study of Dunhuang culture.</p><p>Chinese scholars said that the library cave is Dunhuang’s forever heart-broken archaeological site…</p><p> </p><p>The art of the Mogao Caves is composed of cave architecture, murals and sculptures:</p><p>1. Cave architecture</p><p>There are many variations in the architecture of the 492 caves, some have a rectangular roof and some are in human shape. </p><p>The caves also vary in size, from tiny to huge.</p><p>The temperature inside the caves is as cool as if air-conditioned, in spite of the scorching heat outside.</p><p>The grottos were all carved out of the rock in three tiers, and the large ones are as high as 40 meters extending inwards tens of meters.</p><p>The cave number system was first done by French who looted the most precious literary works.</p><p>Then, the Chinese painter Zhang Daqin numbered the caves. He liked the murals very much.</p><p>Finally, the Dunhuang Research Institute took over the cave numbering.</p><p> </p><p>2. Murals</p><p>In spite of the erosion caused by wind or carbon dioxide for more than 1,300 years, </p><p>the 45,000 square meters of murals still keep their bright colors</p><p>Why have the wall paintings retained much of their bright hues? </p><p>The answer is that the minerals used as pigments are stable and withstood the test of time.</p><p>In addition to thousands of Buddha images painted on the walls, the murals are like today’s comic books, depicting a variety of Buddhist stories.</p><p>Siddartha’s previous lives, the travel of Zhang Qian to the West, a little prince sacrificing himself to save tigers. Everything was vividly painted.</p><p>The murals touch on a wide range of activities, including social activities, architectures, music, clothing, and transportation. </p><p>The Dunhuang scholars have likened the murals to a priceless museum on walls.</p><p> </p><p>3. Sculptures</p><p>In the caves there are some 2,400 painted sculptures, some are tiny in size and some are 30 meters in height.</p><p>In the heyday of the Tang dynasty, the cave sculptures were of the finest quality from the finger poses, </p><p>facial expressions, and the folds in the clothes.</p><p>The guide also complimented the sculptures done in the Song dynasty. </p><p>It is a pity that most of the Song sculptures were on the first floor, they had been completely damaged and very few survived.</p><p>The funniest thing was the guide did not spend much time on the sculptures done in the Qing dynasty because they were of poor quality.</p><p>They did not give the Qing dynasty any credit at all.</p><p>I am fond of Xixia’s lotus floor tiles, very pretty. The title patterns and the sandwich cookie patterns are alike. </p><p>Then I noticed that I had no idea about Xixia and wondered what kind of dynasty it was?</p><p> </p><p>Each of the ten grottos that I visited had its own characteristics and artistic style, </p><p>and the guide was nice and professional, so the 160 RMB admission fee was well-spent.</p><p>I felt pleased that I had came here during my lifetime. It was my honor to visit Mogao Caves.</p><p>The 2-hour tour was very short – I was deeply moved by the variety of caves with their individual art.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030366_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>No camera was allowed within the fenced-off area, there were many photographers outside offered photo service.</p><p>For people who like to take pictures of tourist spots, this is a nice service. It is about 10 RMB a picture.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030362_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I wandered in the shopping area after the tour.</p><p>The souvenir stands could be classified into “for the wealthy” and “for the poor”.</p><p>The mural duplicates of high quality are sold at the “for the wealthy” store, and labeled with price tags in RMB, USD and JPY. </p><p>The average price is about 5,000 RMB. Now, you have some idea about the consumer capabilities of the wealthy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030397_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The “for the poor” stands selling silk scarves and small jewelry were the place for me. </p><p>I felt like buying a scarf to cover my face.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030372_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am headed to Xinjiang which is at higher altitude than Gansu, and needed to prepare myself for the high temperate in the desert.</p><p>I tried on a black scarf.</p><p>“You look like a Muslim” said the stall owner with smile on his face </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030379_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The black one was hot and thick, I almost could not breath. </p><p>I bought a blue one made with breathing material – 20 RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030380_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then, I saw a man making painting on white shirts and asked his permission before taking pictures of him.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030384_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>However, I could not afford the hand-painted shirt, so I just bought small items like this square fabric with “Silk Road” on it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030390_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030388_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Postcards were one item I would buy since they were done by professionals and had better quality than my own shots. </p><p>They also gave out flavor of traveling.</p><p>I chose a Dunhuang 14 scenes combination package containing 22 cards – 40 RMB on price tag. </p><p>The stall staff gave me a discount – half price, 20 RMB.</p><p>Wasn’t it over-exaggerated? The price was cut in half before I even started bargaining, </p><p>which told me that I would be an idiot not to haggle.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030391_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I got a 20 RMB bill out and told the stall staff “this is all I got,</p><p>and I need to take the public bus back to Dunhuang downtown before handing over the money,</p><p>It was obvious that they either sold it for 12 RMB or did not sell it at all.</p><p>Of course, he took the money and gave me the 8 RMB change with no hesitation. </p><p>His quick reaction made me wonder what the real cost of the postcards were with a feeling of regret.</p><p>Never mind, at least it was discounted and I did have more than 20 RMB in my pocket.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030393_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The Dunhuang train station is on the way to Dunhuang downtown, </p><p>in the suburbs close to the airport. It seemed it was under reconstruction. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030414_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought an ice cold juice to quench my thirst after getting back to downtown. </p><p>Only if money were not money, would I pay the boosted prices at the tourist attraction.</p><p>I got a 20 RMB cents bill change back that I had never seen before. It had Korean influence.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030419_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Tonight, I had lamb meat fen soup, stir-fried lamb offal and xinpi water for dinner at the “Oasis Market” again.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030420_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The lamb meat fen soup was lamb meat with vermicelli in light broth – quite yummy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030423_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As for the stir-fried lamb offal, I could not figure it out what they were either by looking or by tasting. </p><p>However the cumin in the dish made everything tasty.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030424_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The large ice cold “xinpi water” tasted like the lighter version of the dark plum juice. </p><p>It has the nickname ‘remedy for summer heat” which was very true.</p><p> </p><p>Today’s expense including the entrance fee for Mogao Caves, small souvenirs, food and drink was about 300 RMB.</p><p>Tomorrow I would be visiting Crescent Lake and Mt Mingsha</p><p>[also known as Mingsha Mountain, Singing Sand Mountain or Echoing Sand Mountain]. </p><p>The entrance fee was 80 RMB and the camel ride fee was 60 RMB. </p><p>Dunhuang just burned my travel money!!</p><p>Today was the day which made me feel that I was really traveling the Silk Road. </p><p>If it was possible, I would like to stay one more day to explore more of the attractions of the Silk Road.</p><p><br /></p>
