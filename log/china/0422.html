										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-2_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p>Just like I suspected, the night prior to my departure I couldn’t sleep… After all I could take a little nap.</p><p>At dawn, I woke up earlier than my alarm clock set at 5 o’clock.</p><p>I desired to take a shower, wash myself to get my stamina back.</p><p>Before I could shower, I had a stomach upset and without breakfast it unwillingly threw up some stomach fluid.</p><p> </p><p>I felt the spasm and shakes of my stomach and a bitter acid flavor in my mouth,</p><p>It woke me up immediately and brought me back to reality. I am not dreaming.</p><p>Also this announced the truth that in 3 more hours I will depart from Taiwan and start my adventure.</p><p> </p><p>I wanted to shout Bring it On! Because I am about to take my first step!</p><p>No matter what you do, the first step is the hardest that’s why most people retreat before even stepping out. </p><p> </p><p>After cleansing myself, my friend took Misasa and I to the airport terminal 2 with his little truck</p><p>Before laying down yesterday night I double checked my luggage till 0100, </p><p>but I know for sure that I forgot something.</p><p>Within 10 minutes away from home I realized that my glasses and camera are all in a box</p><p>This means that there will be no pictures for the good time </p><p>and I will be half blind for the rest of the trip till I clear custom in Beijing.</p><p> </p><p>That’s not a big deal at least I brought them with me and I remember where I put them.</p><p>But I also left the good luck amulet that my aunt troubled to go to the temple and asked it for me.</p><p>Half way we returned home to get that amulet. </p><p>Rush and nervous in the morning is not a good sign. Is there anything else that I forgot?</p><p>With thoughts like a traffic jam we arrived at the airport before 0700.</p><p> </p><p>Went to EVA airline’s counter and checked in my luggage and got my boarding pass.</p><p>Yesterday night at RST, teacher Hong sir,</p><p>besides teaching me how to change a bike chain I also learned to dissemble and assemble my bike.</p><p>After taking apart the front tire, front fender, front break, front pack holder, </p><p>seat and steering, we could finally fit the bike in the box.</p><p>I will carry on a back pack with me, the other 3 big pack, a small pack, </p><p>sleeping bag, helmet and other stuffs went into another box</p><p>Make 2 simple boxes. Either I lose everything or everything will land safely into my hand. </p><p> </p><p>Back to the EVA Airline counter. After putting the boxes on the weight it displayed 41.9Kg. </p><p>The limit weight for one passenger’s luggage is 25Kg</p><p>Therefore it’s overweight by 17Kg. Even though I knew that my luggage will be overweight but it still was out of my calculus.</p><p>Without the bike’s weight of 16Kg and add my carry on pack weight of 7Kg, I am taking above 30Kg of luggage on this trip.</p><p>This will be a though trip for my partner LGS-GMT the bike.</p><p> </p><p>By airline rules, there’s surcharge for overweight luggage. With EVA airline’s help they allowed my limit to 35Kg</p><p>Therefore I only paid for 7Kg and it cost me 2400NT</p><p> </p><p>Ming said that he wouldn’t be able to wake up and farewell me at the airport, however for my surprise he was present.</p><p>We chat for a while. Thanks to him that this trip will have a pleasant start</p><p>At the same time to view and deal with issues differently. I am somehow childish in contrast Ming is lot more matured.</p><p> </p><p>At 8:30AM I kissed Misasa on the forehead and told her to take care of herself </p><p>and that I will be back soon and I left to catch my 9:15 flight.</p><p> </p><p>Taipei to Hong Kong flight only takes about an hour just about the time needed to take breakfast.</p><p>It’s so excited to arrive to Hong Kong airport! It’s such a gorgeous airport!</p><p>This is my first time in Hong Kong, however I don’t have time to leave the airport.</p><p>I could only “eyes shop” the duty free stores in my short 2 hour transit.</p><p>I also went to the airport’s free internet cafe and waited for my 12:45 flight to Beijing.</p><p>My flight from Hong Kong to Beijing is with China Eastern Airline. </p><p>About the stewardess, I can only say sensational. China is vast of resources and that’s why we have excellent choices.</p><p> </p><p>It’s noon and that means another airplane meal. </p><p>The comparison between the fine quality of the stewardess and </p><p>the meal is negatively progressive. Better are the stewardess worse is the food.</p><p>Anyways, I still finished my meal.</p><p>I even took the bread and the butter that the passenger next to me left for emergency food.</p><p>Maybe China Eastern knows that the food wasn’t good enough, </p><p>so they gave us Haagen Dazs Ice Cream for desert. That’s quite a difference.</p><p>  </p><p>I changed seat with the grandpa sitting at the window sit next to me</p><p>(He gave me the left over bread). I looked out and there’s China.</p><p>My first impression was “So yellowish. It’s a country full of yellow mud.</p><p> </p><p>I arrived at Beijing airport at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. </p><p>It’s very obvious that the airport’s operation flow is not well designed. </p><p>Specially when I just passed by Taiwan and Hong Kong airport.</p><p>After disembarking, a bunch of passenger stuck at the small electrical stair </p><p>and the stair beside it. And the immigration is an exaggeration.</p><p>It’s like a Mecca, no matter the Chinese waiting line or the foreigner waiting line, is all long and full.</p><p>After waiting for a long while in this long line, the immigration will verify your documents. </p><p>After that there’s a service feedback button.</p><p>The options are: Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Regular, Slow, No Good.</p><p>I pushed at the SLOW button for as much times as I could, then left happily.</p><p> </p><p>Finding my luggage is another lesson to be learned. I have two luggages; </p><p>one is regular stuff which I can pick it up at the belt just like everybody else.</p><p>But my bike is considered as a over sized luggage which supposed to be hand carried to another luggage pick up zone, </p><p>just like my last trip at France; where they carried my bike to a pick up zone even earlier than my other luggage.</p><p>At that time getting my bike was a huge relive.</p><p> </p><p>Now at Beijing airport, I pushed the luggage cart round and around and I just can’t find my bike.</p><p>My luggage came out of the luggage belt but where is my bike?</p><p>I waited and waited till the belt stopped and no more luggage where coming out of the belt </p><p>and I still haven’t seen my bike. I was petrified.</p><p>I grabbed a person who looked like someone who is in charged of carrying luggage </p><p>and asked him: “there’s a box with a bike on this flight can you tell me where it is?”</p><p> </p><p>If he answered never seen or heard of that, then it means my bike was left at Hong Kong.</p><p>Thankfully he gave me a “oh that box is yours” expression and pointed at the end of the pick up zone </p><p>and told me “It’s over there”.</p><p> </p><p>Bloody, it’s so far away. The pick up zone has 8 belts. My flight used luggage belt 7 and he took my bike to belt 1.</p><p>Anyways it’s good news and a relive for me. I thanked the guy and pushed my cart and run towards my bike.</p><p>At the same time a horrifying picture just flashed in front of me. Someone was taking that box down and BAM, dropped it.</p><p>What the heck!! That’s my bike. The box was already a little damaged when I was packing it yesterday.</p><p>I stick so much fragile sticker to it but it was in vain. Nobody cared.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever, I was happy to get it back. My luggage, my bike and me, all present.</p><p>My watch marked 5 o’clock in the afternoon. I asked information counter is there’s road to ride bike to Beijing.</p><p>The three ladies looked at each other and told me: </p><p>“There’s road (not highways) but you have to ask other people we don’t know where it is.”</p><p> </p><p>My original plan was to take airport bus to the city and then assemble my bike at the sidewalk.</p><p>This is can be accomplished in France because nobody will take advantage while you are working with the bike </p><p>and steal your bags and when you ran frustrated after that guy, another guy grab your bike and scatters.</p><p> </p><p>However this is China. A beautiful country which I respect and have high expectation </p><p>but at the same time I am also very cautious</p><p>Without knowing my route from airport to Beijing, I have to get there and find a cheap place to stay for the night. </p><p>I don’t even know where are the hotels therefore nothing is certain for the moment.</p><p> </p><p>With my luggage and my bike on the cart, the time 5 o’clock, I threw myself options. </p><p>Should I spend about 30 minutes to 1 hour to assemble the bike and try to ride 30Km about 2 hours. </p><p>If everything is smooth I will arrive to Beijing at about 8o’clock and search for a place to spend my first night in Beijing.</p><p> </p><p>Or should I take the airport bus to Beijing. After getting there take the risk of getting robbed on the sidewalk, </p><p>assemble my bike and find a place to spend the night.</p><p> </p><p>Seems like there’s only two options, each one with its costs and some risk.</p><p>While I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do a guy in suit approached and asked me “What’s in the box?”</p><p>I looked at him even he was wearing suit but he must be taxi driver looking for its prey. I replied “bike”</p><p>He said: “You are going to Beijing right? I will take you. Let’s go~”</p><p>I didn’t agree and haven’t tell him my destination and he is already asking me to follow him.</p><p>“How much you will charge me?”</p><p>I didn’t deny him instead I asked for the fare because this might be the third option to my choices.</p><p> </p><p>“All this stuffs… For you 300 RMB!”</p><p>“That’s too much; I don’t have that much money.” I turned away looking for the bus station.</p><p>Just as I expected, after 5 seconds he chased me down “so how much you willing to pay?”</p><p>“150”</p><p>Even if you are not a bargain expert and you don’t know about the regular prices,</p><p>you only have to remember the principal of “50% off”. </p><p>Just go for half of whatever they are charging you. </p><p>He waved his hand and left me right after I told him my offer. Well,</p><p>it’s not bad either; at least nobody is bugging me now.</p><p> </p><p>I pushed my cart in search of the bus station without finding it. </p><p>And just when I was going to turn back the guy brought a young, tall skinny guy towards me.</p><p>We spoke at the same time.</p><p>“That’s it, 250!” The taxi driver said.</p><p>“200!” I shouted out at the exact same time.</p><p>He then shake his head in disapproval, sighed and said “220, shall we go?”</p><p> </p><p>I accepted this offer by the driver; however is the skinny tall young man who took me. </p><p>I questioned him at once “you are not taking me?” was he only in charged of negotiation?</p><p>“His my younger brother, it’s the same as I take you. </p><p>You have big luggage only his car can take you. My little taxi won’t fit.” He replied.</p><p>I followed his “brother” and shouted back to him</p><p>“your brother? You don’t really look alike. Are you sure he is your brother?”</p><p>Other taxi drivers laughed and said in lower voice</p><p>“Of course they don’t look alike. Not from the same mother…”</p><p> </p><p>I followed him and walked pass the road in front of the airport and entered the parking lot.</p><p>Three floors below it’s already dark enough to alert me.</p><p>What kind of driver will park his car in such place?</p><p>After getting the customer, you make him walk so far? Is he going to rob me in the parking lot?</p><p>“Here it is, this is the car”</p><p>When I was preparing myself for a brutal robbery, I saw his black sedan.</p><p>My packs go in the back seat and my bike in the truck. </p><p>Truly this is car is larger and my bike fit in the truck with a little part coming out without bothering.</p><p> </p><p>I settled myself in the car and asked for his name. </p><p>His name is Anthony from Beijing, He drives customer from airport to hotels.</p><p>The other guy was one of the few who had access to the airport lounge.</p><p>Therefore he is in charged of getting all the customers and then assign to others.</p><p>Then I told Anthony that I am from Hong Kong and the box in the truck is a bike and that I plan to ride from Beijing to Xian. </p><p>We chatted more and more and the conversation just grew.</p><p>Anthony is a very interesting guy. I asked him why Beijing accent sounds so nice.</p><p>He said that is because they speak in “longer” tune.</p><p>And that people from Guangdong like me (he believed that I am from Hong Kong) speaks short tunes word by word.</p><p> </p><p>Immediately I learned the catch of Beijing accent. I have to speak in longer tune.</p><p>Within our lengthy conversation I ask Anthony that each trip’s earning is two o three hundreds, </p><p>therefore he must have a very substantial salary.</p><p>He told me that the fare he collects in a while from me will be turned in. His salary is 2000RMB per month.</p><p>If by chance he tumbles to a generous customer with a big tip then there’s some extra earning for him. </p><p> </p><p>I also asked him that even this is Airport Highway, why the speed is so low.</p><p>Anthony told me that there’s a toll ahead and the fee is 10 RMB. </p><p>I wondered why he was telling me this detail. Was he introducing the toll to me?</p><p>Then he said: “10 RMB please. You have to cover this”.</p><p>I was surprised that even paying the taxi fare when passing through highway toll I have to pay. This is outrageous.</p><p>Fare is fare and toll fee is toll fee. This is distinguished very clearly.</p><p> </p><p>In my wallet I only have the 300RMB that Bianca gave me. Taxi fare is 220 and 10 more for the toll fee.</p><p>I still have to find a place to spend the night. What should I do now?</p><p>Anthony admires me and considers that traveling with a bike alone is very manly.</p><p>Therefore I told Anthony that I only have 300RMB with me, </p><p>and if he could help me find a hotel to spend the night</p><p>then what is left of 300RMB after the hotel and Taxi fare will be his tip.</p><p> </p><p>Anthony told me that in Beijing the cheapest hotel costs 300RMB per night. </p><p>With luck you can find a 158RMB per night hotel.</p><p>It’s almost impossible to find a place with my budget.</p><p>By the hotel classification it’s hotel, motel and then? </p><p>I hope it’s not on the street. There’s a place called dormitory.</p><p>It cost about 50RMB per night.</p><p>He called his “sister” and asked if there’s any room left.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s no vacancy.</p><p> </p><p>Doesn’t matter where it is as long as it’s close to Beijing even if it’s 10Km away from Tian Tan (Temple of Heaven).</p><p>As a native of Beijing, it’s easier for Anthony to find a cheap hotel than riding around by myself.</p><p>Somewhere in Beijing Anthony found a place that he remembered that it’s cheap.</p><p>After getting there he instructed me to stay in the car because my foreign</p><p>accent will not help to bargain. He will go scout for me.</p><p>I stayed in the car and raised my head and read “Bright Morning Hotel”. It’s a hotel; I don’t think it will be cheap.</p><p> </p><p>After a minute, Anthony came back with a smile.</p><p>I asked him how much the night was. He told me laughing that it’s 55 bucks the night.</p><p>Better for me. It’s only the first day and I found a cheap hotel and it’s quiet around here.</p><p>Then I can assemble my bike put it back to my room.</p><p>And that is how I solved three problems at once: get to Beijing, assemble my bike and a place to spend my first night.</p><p> </p><p>I was just feeling relaxed when that “not so easy” feeling came to me.</p><p>The clerk of the hotel asked me for identification to check me in at the hotel.</p><p>And of course when he asked for identification he didn’t mean Taiwan passport.</p><p>I shamefully took out my Taiwanese permit and told him in low voices</p><p>that I am from Taiwan, trying to avoid Anthony hearing.</p><p>Then the guy asked me from Taiwan? Then you don’t have identification?</p><p>Outside Anthony herd his comment and came in to help. </p><p>“What is the problem?” he asked “He is from Hong Kong”</p><p>Full of embarrassment I explained to Anthony that I am actually from Taiwan. </p><p>The clerk was nice enough to let me stay anyways because foreigners are not allowed in this type hotel.</p><p>55 per night and I paid 60. 5 RMB as deposit.</p><p>Therefore, from my 300RMB there’s taxi fare of 220,</p><p>the toll fee of 10, 60 for the hotel there’s only 10 bucks left for Anthony’s tip.</p><p>Fate brought us together, so he was very happy anyways. He still admires me for riding bike alone.</p><p> </p><p>Anthony didn’t return to the airport at once. </p><p>He stayed to watch me assemble the bike because he wanted to see what it looks like.</p><p>Then I finally could open my luggage box and take my camera for today’s first picture.</p><p>Anthony saw my car and exclaimed: “This is an excellent bike. It sure is expensive right? Does it cost 1000RMB?”</p><p>I don’t think it’s good to tell him that it costs about 5000RMB. </p><p>So I nodded and told him that it cost around 1000RMB and added that it’s a regular bike.</p><p>Then he asked: “What brand it is? I have never seen it before”</p><p>I felt that it would be too complicated to explain that my bike is Louis Garneau from Canada, </p><p>so I told him that I didn’t know what brand is that and</p><p>“I bought it because it’s cheap and I liked it.”</p><p> </p><p>Thanks to Anthony for helping me to find this hotel and made the first step of my bike trip without big obstacles.</p><p>In general it seems to be going nicely.</p><p>Before he went back to work I took a picture of him.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000328_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Bright Morning Hotel’s Clerk is called Mario. </p><p>He saw that one of my luggages is a bike and I was getting ready to assemble it. </p><p>He took out a bunch of tools and helped me with the screws.</p><p>I made some mistakes in some spots and he was first to correct me. What a shame~~</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000329_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A gentleman of about 60 years old approached us watching us assemble the bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000332_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>We chatted while we were assembling the bike.</p><p>I also told Mario that I was going to ride from Beijing to Xian (I also only told him till Xian)</p><p>The elder’s last name is Zhao so Mario called him Zhao Sir and I followed.</p><p>I am 26 years old in Taiwan but in mainland China I am considered 27. Mario is 25 younger than me.</p><p>Zhao Sir asked me where I am from. I replied that the answer is a bit sensitive.</p><p>Mario took the liberty to answer for me. He told Zhao Sir that I am from Taiwan.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000336_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Zhao Sir laughed and said what so sensitive about that?</p><p>With Zhao Sir we are considered the three musketeers assembling the bike.</p><p>From front break, front tire, front fender, front stand, pedals, handlebar, seat, one by one we assembled.</p><p>The carelessness handling during flights bent my rear fender. It severely rub against the back tire when I ride it.</p><p>Mario and Zhao sir spend a while helping me to adjust the fender till it’s back to normal position.</p><p>I test ride the bike after assembly. It’s perfect. I lowered the seat and let Mario and Zhao sir to test ride it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000335_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After the test ride I wanted to take the bike back to my room.</p><p>Mario didn’t give the key only told me that it’s room 144 and told me to go down someone will open for me.</p><p>Room 144 is not on the first floor like it usually is. </p><p>And it certainly is not on the 14th floor but on third floor down to the basement. </p><p>There are about fifty rooms down the basement. </p><p>I will stay in a single which is not as small as I imagined. </p><p>The hotel is somehow populous; I believe that it’s about 80% full. </p><p>There are one single bed, one bed side table, one chair and a reddish color television in the room. </p><p>The ceiling’s paint is already falling. It’s stylish in a way.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000339_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After settling my bike in the room, I went back upstairs to bring down my packs. </p><p>I took half of them and Mario helped me with the other half.</p><p>I took the chance to ask Mario what he is going to eat for dinner that I would like to join him.</p><p>My idea was that since there’s a local friend I might as well go with him and eat something economic.</p><p> </p><p>I organized my packs after getting back to my room.</p><p>I watched China’s Central News. (This is a very cool channel to bad that we don’t have that in Taiwan)</p><p>Beijing at night is very cold. I am at third floor down the basement and the coldness just overwhelms me. </p><p>Thank God there’s a warm blanket for me to hide inside.</p><p>Around 8 o’clock, Mario knocked my door asking me to join him for dinner.</p><p>My stomach was already making those complaining sounds.</p><p>I dropped what I was doing and went upstairs with my slippers.</p><p> </p><p>I thought that Mario was going to take me to a cheap local restaurant. </p><p>Since I finished up my 300RMB in my first day I grabbed another 100 bill expecting to get some change too.</p><p> </p><p>I got upstairs to the counter and I realized that we were not going to a restaurant.</p><p>Mario cooked few dishes and warmed few white buns and Voila! Dinner it is!</p><p>“I made this dish myself, taste it, hope it suits you.”</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000341_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Zhao sir also joined us for dinner and chat.</p><p>Mario made stir fried bean sprout mixed with Chinese ham and yam leaves.</p><p>Together with the white bun, this meal is far better than what I had on airplane. I was so full.</p><p>Zhao sir asked if I would like a drink. “Want some?”</p><p>I modestly answer: “I can handle a couple of drink.”</p><p>『Zhao sir laughed and said: “Said and done then, Mario, please buy 2 more glasses.”</p><p> </p><p>Mongolian wine (Alcohol 38%, 1.5RMB a glass) with Mario’s dishes and the white buns.</p><p>As a foreigner I wasn’t truthful about my identity. </p><p>I didn’t admit that I am from Taiwan to avoid any unnecessary troubles.</p><p>Zhao sir told me that I am doing the right thing. </p><p>It’s better to stay low profiled. There are a lot of people </p><p>and all king of people in China therefore it’s necessary to be cautious.</p><p> </p><p>I found out that Zhao sir was a Kuomintang party member, </p><p>when Kuomintang was retreating to Taiwan; he had a plane ticket with him. </p><p>But he couldn’t leave his mother alone in China so he decided to stay.</p><p>And because of his past membership, he was sent several times to Hebei for labor reform which summed up 3 years.</p><p> </p><p>He asked me if I did the military service. I did and I was in Military Police Command.</p><p>He then requested me to sing some Kuomintang’s party songs. He really missed it.</p><p>But I only knew our Military Police exercising songs and other songs invented by fellows in the command.</p><p>I really didn’t know how to sing Kuomintang’s song.</p><p> </p><p>I had a 100 bill with me that needed to be changed in to smaller bills; </p><p>otherwise I won’t be able to use it because no one will have change for that.</p><p>I planned to use that for dinner and go a mini market to buy some supplies and get some change back.</p><p>Zhao sir told me that my accent is not good enough people will know that you are not local and give you fake bills in return.</p><p>He told me that if I needed anything just ask Mario to go for me </p><p>and that if I only needed some instant noodles Mario has that at the hotel. Mario wouldn’t give me fake bills.</p><p> </p><p>Enjoying the salty food and the sweetened wine, I am actually filled with their hospitality.</p><p>Mario asked me what I was going to do once I get to Xian and if I wanted him to keep the empty boxed for the return trip. </p><p>He wondered how I was going to accommodate my luggage.</p><p>I told him that after my departure tomorrow, I will not come back to Beijing.</p><p>Zhao sir asked: “Then where are you going?”</p><p> </p><p>I told them that I was going to take the silk trail to Urumqi. They dropped their chopsticks.</p><p>“How long you will ride?”</p><p>“There’s no rush. I will go slowly and one day I will get there.”</p><p> </p><p>“After you get there you won’t return to Beijing either?”</p><p>“mmh, (I confirmed with my mouth full of bun and bean sprout).”</p><p>After swallowing the food, I continued “I will keep riding to Kazakhstan”</p><p>“And then?” The two of them looked at me in amaze.</p><p>“Then I will continue to Russia, then to Ukraine and then Poland.”</p><p>“Where the heck you are going? Is there a final destination?” </p><p>This expression sounded to me a little ridiculous.</p><p>“Of course! If everything goes as planned I will end up in France and that’s where I use up all my energy” </p><p>We laughed and cheer each other with the wine.</p><p> </p><p>After a glass of wine, I felt dazed.</p><p>Where I am? At homeland or abroad?</p><p>Who are Anthony, Mario and Zhao sir? Foreigner or compatriot?</p><p> </p><p>Before and drop myself down on bed I wanted to take a bath.</p><p>However the guy in charge of the bathroom told me that I have buy bath ticket.</p><p>Well, then forget it. I just wiped myself with wet tower and that’s it.</p><p>Besides killing a zooming mosquito, I left no more feelings in my One Night in Beijing</p><p> </p><p>My day started well, I arrived well, </p><p>got my gears without incident and found a place to stay for the night without hazard. </p><p>This is my first day in Beijing.</p><p>I don’t want to be represent Taiwan and I don’t want to be somebody. I don’t even want to be known or famous.</p><p>I am just a regular guy who wakes up in the morning and get stomach upsets when I am nervous.</p><p>I am a regular guy who is afraid of getting too exhausted in the first day so decided to cheat and take a taxi.</p><p> </p><p>I am who I am. I am Deray who work hard and willing to bet my life to make a dream come true.</p><p>Therefore; there’s no hero here.</p></div>
