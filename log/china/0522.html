It’s going to be an easy task, so, I’m not hurry to move out early. </span></p><p>My plan was to ride 25 kilometers from the place I stay last night. </p><p>If my pace it right, I can have lunch over Jiu-Quan city when arrived. </p><p>Take a nape after I’m full then heading to my next 25 kilometers to Jia-Yu-Guan, </p><p>before 3 o’clock in the afternoon then have some meals and find my over night stay.</p><p>What a nice day, it is!</p><p> </p><p>The weather report shown heavy rain alert on the south-east China. </p><p>The raining alert included Beijing all the way south and Zheng-Zhou city to Lanzhou city on the west. </p><p>I am so lucky that area were all behind me. Other wise, I will be ether watching the heavy rain and sigh or struggled in the rain.</p><p> </p><p>On the way to Jiu-Quan city, some cotton like fiber flying every where. </p><p>It came from the trees standing by the road. The wind keep blowing, carrying those cotton like fiber all over the place. </p><p>It goes into my nose, into my mouth, or came around my glasses into my eyes…</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020678_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As my plan, I was arriving Jiu-Quan city at 12 o’clock. </p><p>The weather still cloudy and chill, the sun still stays behind the heavy cloud. </p><p>A little bit of rain, comes and goes. I can see the heavy cloud moving south-east by the strong wind. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020680_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were petals blown by the wind all around the road to Jiu-Quan. What a romantic city it is! (to see a road cover with flowers)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020693_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Sliced noodle was the lunch I had here. </p><p>The noodle cost differently by the size of extra, large and small. </p><p>I never try anything called extra, so I order it. After the noodle was there, </p><p>I found out the difference was putting more meat in it, so called “extra”.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020701_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is which I often mention about people leaving their food and came to check out my bike. </p><p>After I taking this picture and put my camera in my bag. Answering a lot of funny question will start to happen. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020697_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went to the store when finished my meal. I need to get more supplies. </p><p>I am going all the way to U-ru-mqi city. I guess it is 1800 kilometers away.</p><p> </p><p>I bought a big pack of Hsia-Wei-Hsien (It’s a shrimp flavor kind of snake), </p><p>Six of Sha-Qi-Ma (a Manchurian snake), one Shan-Zha-Pai (cookies make from fruits of Haw tree) and cost me 6.5 Chinese dollars. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020703_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I enjoying my Shan-Zha-Pai and heading to Jia-Yu-Guan, I saw this sign. </p><p>It explains that I am not far from that city. Suddenly, I realized Lan-zhou city was way behind me…</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020698_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It’s alright to have a little head wind. </p><p>The branch of the trees was lower down gently is now blowing by the strong wind which makes them swinging back and forth. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020707_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It’s OK to have a little rain shower. </p><p>The weather man mention about the serious drought, having a bit of rain will be nice. </p><p>Well, the rain was light, I don’t need to put on my rain coat. </p><p>I think it will stop raining later on. </p><p>(I had this same thought when I was riding in the mountain. It turn out that I was soaking wet that time.) </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020710_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Shin-Shin canyon (It means Star canyon) was the boundary of Gan-Su province and Xin-Jiang province. </p><p>It was beautiful, just hearing the name of that place. </p><p>I plan to stay one night over there. But, why was the sign say “Gorilla canyon”? </p><p>(The pronouncing of those Chinese words, Shin-Shin and gorilla, sounds exactly the same) </p><p>It makes a lot of different to me. I don’t want to stay in a place with many gorillas. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020708_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Arriving Jia-Yu-Guan at 2 PM and finish up today’s trip.</p><p>I can rest even before worming up. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</p><p>Looking for a place to stay over night when I was ridding. I ask some curious people, </p><p>which is the right way? How can I go to the Great Wall? Could I go in with my bike? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020713_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Jia-Yu-Guan was the west end of the Great Wall. </p><p>It is the most important fortress of national defenses, for many years. </p><p>In the old time, once you go out from this fortress, will be foreign country. </p><p>I want to visit the Great Wall tomorrow, even just passing by the front door. </p><p>If I came to China without seeing the Great Wall, seems like something was missing. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020715_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As I was seeking a place to stay over night, I went into a market place. There was this little hotel which cost me 15 Chinese dollars for one night. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020720_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was near by the market place and other stores; it’s good for me to add more supplies. </p><p>If I walk out of the market place, the main street was close to the internet cafe? </p><p>I think this will be the right place for me tonight. The owner asks me to park my bike out side. </p><p>But, I insist to sleep with my lovely bike. </p><p>The tiny crowded room with all my baggage and my bike made me had to move everything when I want to open the door. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020721_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Every time when I found a place to stay, I always check with few things. </p><p>First of all, to find where could I wash my clothes. </p><p>Then I had to find the restroom. Finally, I will grab a bottle of hot water. </p><p>Every time when people saw me and my gears, they ask me where did I come from? </p><p>This hotel owner asks the same thing.</p><p>I said that I come from Xi-An to Lanzhou then arrived here. I will go to Xian-Jiang, later on. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, I saw his face shown a bit of loneliness and sadness. I did not know what is going on, but, I did not ask. </p><p> </p><p>Put on comfortable clothing, it is my style of pajamas. </p><p>Going to start my dirty laundry by hand for all of my clothes I wear in these 2 days. </p><p>The boss said he can lend me the washing machine since, I got so many clothes. </p><p> </p><p>Wow! It is a washing machine even though it is a super antique. </p><p> </p><p>After, putting my dirty clothes and detergent, the water had to pour in by hand. </p><p>But, it really can help for cleaning my clothes. I put the clothes in and went back to my room for washing powder. </p><p>The detergent was inside of the washing machine when I came back, it was the boss. </p><p>He told me that his son study in Xi-An when I was pouring water into the washing machine. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020729_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>“Oh~ which one?” I pretended was came from Xi-An, so I ask like I was living there. </p><p>“Xi-Jing University” He puffs out his cigarette and reply slowly. </p><p>The smoke went out side but, that lonesome feeling still stays on his face. </p><p>His son was 4 years younger than me. </p><p>Although he did not say much, I can feel that his son was not visiting his father often, after he went to college. </p><p>I supposed the sad feeling of the boss was came form me, </p><p>because I came from Xi-An and about the same age, so he started to missing his son. </p><p> </p><p>Remind me a young man setting beside when I went to an internet cafe?, </p><p>in Xi-An. He was video chatting with his friend. He mentions a fight with him and his father makes him mad. </p><p>He plans not going home for the next coming year to piss off the father. </p><p>Even the chances of the kid in the internet cafe? </p><p>and the owner of this hotel were father and son was one in a billion. </p><p> </p><p>If the son of the boss can see what I saw the lonesome farther. </p><p>Remember come back to Jiu-Quan and check out your family, OK?</p><p> </p><p>My clothes were spinning in the washing machine for few minutes and the water turned into the color of the water after you mopped the floor. </p><p>I took a big washbowl and clean up the clothes manually then put it into a dryer. </p><p>It’s really easy to clean up my stuff with washing machine. </p><p>After, hang up these clothes, I will have clean stuff to ware again. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020730_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finishing the dirty laundry and take a bath, I decided to go to the market place for shopping.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020718_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Continue my supplies of snacks; I bought 4 packs of milk; 2 original flavor, 1 peanut flavor, 1 malt flavor. 2 packs of peanuts</p><p>(it’s very good for supply your energy, its high caloric) </p><p>and something I never think I will buy it “canned peaches”. </p><p>I was curious about the price, so I ask the lady how much? </p><p>It’s 7 Chinese dollars, not much for a size like this and looks tasty. </p><p>Than the lady said something which made me wants to buy it. </p><p>“You can use it as water can, after you’re finished the peaches”! </p><p>I already got my water bottles but, she makes me think of some other thing which I can put it into this can. OK! You got this deal.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020724_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the way back to my hotel, it rain like hell. Nothing like the rain was gently dripping, not long ago. </p><p>Luckily, I am going to rest for today. Imagine if I was still on the road, I’ll be soaking wet by now. </p><p>Running back to my hotel and started to enjoy my cookies and peaches. </p><p>I lying on the bed and writing my journal. Suddenly, I felt very sleepy. </p><p>Maybe, I should take a good sleep and doing nothing all day. </p><p>I think it will be nice. </p><p> </p><p>On the dinner hour, I went to the market place. </p><p>All those stand and store was turn into night market with all kinds of foods. </p><p>I saw something looked like those food stand selling salty fried chicken nugget in Taiwan. </p><p>But, this one got a pot with dark color oil frying. Every thing cost 50 Chinese cents and everything was on stick. </p><p>I pick 2 pieces of smelly tofu, 2 pieces of fried sweat potato ball, one mini sausage. </p><p> </p><p>Everything goes into that dark color oil and deep fry. </p><p>They will brush salty chilly source and some vinegar if you like it. </p><p>In this little food stands without any chair, the cook will ask you having it there or take it out. </p><p>If you want to have it there, they will put it on a little plat and ate it while you standing beside the stand. </p><p> </p><p>When I was eating there and watching him selling his food. </p><p>There are many choices, from green pepper to baked flower cake. </p><p>It tastes nice but, I was wondering if it is local flavor or just an ordinary food stand. </p><p> </p><p>Walking around the night market when I eating this funny salty food. </p><p>I order some pork’s ear stew with soy beam source. </p><p>They sliced it for me and add some shred spring onion, mash garlic and some other spice. </p><p>It only cost me 4 Chinese dollars and 20 cents. </p><p>It will be great for me to have it when I watching movie at home. </p><p> </p><p>80 percent of the restaurant in this night market selling goat meat barbecue. </p><p>The number was so great which makes me sense a kind of exotic feeling.</p><p><br /></p>
