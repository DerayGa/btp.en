										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-33_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">It was still a great sunny day like yesterday, the wind still blew toward me, but at least was not as harsh anymore.</span></p><p>Before anything else, I went to an internet café to confirm my website was up and running normally. </p><p>Then I packed my stuff and got ready to go.</p><p> </p><p>I decided not to have breakfast here, so I bought some sliced soy sauce braised pork to eat while biking. </p><p>Maybe that would be a brunch for now, but I can always find something to eat on the way later.</p><p> </p><p>I started on Rt 312, a national highway, and thought all I had to do was to stay on it for like 100 km. </p><p>Then YuMen, my final stop for today, would be there waiting for me.</p><p>Guess what? As soon as I left Jiayuguan (Jiayu pass), </p><p>The NATIONAL HIGHTWAY 312 all of a sudden became a couldn't-be-worst unpaved gravel road, </p><p>but I didn't see anybody was working on the road, either. </p><p>I wondered if the gravels are the result of the construction work or will be the target of the future construction work. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020935_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Can't bear the thought of the damage could have done to my Dido, </p><p>I decided to walk with Dido, and kept asking myself that how much longer I have to do this?</p><p>Amazingly, Rt 312 was gone. This was a NATIONAL highway, but it was just gone, period.</p><p>Well, there was another highway parallel to this disappeared one, but bikes were not allowed, </p><p>and it was protected by wired fence, very hard to sneak into it.</p><p>However, somewhere along the way, I found a damaged section, obviously was man-made, </p><p>so I carried my Dido passing the fence and started riding on that highway.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020937_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Compare to what I was on earlier, riding on this smooth and straight highway was so great.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020984_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As long as I was not stopped at the tollbooth, I could stay on this highway for as long as I want. </p><p>Because once you were on the highway, even the highway patrols would not kick you out nor would they stop you.</p><p>As to the tollbooth, you can either directly pass it like regular cars, or sneak around it with guilt.</p><p>The worst scenario, if you got caught by the booth collector or highway patrol, </p><p>try to play innocent while they warned you that how dangerous it could be to ride a bike on the highway. </p><p>You usually can get away safely then.</p><p> </p><p>One thing strange here, the three lanes on one side were closed for 30 km without under any kind of construction.</p><p>Therefore, all cars had to share the 3 lanes on the other side.</p><p>Those cars were so fast and crazy.</p><p>So I decided to shift back to the closed-but-not-under-construction side. </p><p>Only Dido and I were on this nice part of the highway.</p><p>I can ride anyway I like. I can make a S pattern or even W pattern (zigzag). </p><p>I did not get honked by those trucks. I was happy even today was another upwind day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020999_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just like this, I did not have any chance to find a hotel and food until 8:30 later at night.</p><p>All I had the whole day was milk, crackers, instant noodles and peanuts. </p><p>Not really enough for an active guy like me, but at least they offered enough calories for a while. </p><p>Little embarrassing to say this: </p><p>I didn't feel too well after drinking that milk, so I had to pollute the desert with my "you-know-what".</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020949_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Oh. I saw a tornado today. It started as a small swirl. </p><p>Gradually it whirled up the sands to form the typical funnel shape of a tornado. </p><p>It passed by within 5 meters away from me, so all the sands directly blew on me, like thousands of needles darting on my face.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020942_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Somehow I know people may or may not believe me when I said that </p><p>Dido was the only CAR on the highway and I could ride whatever way I want.</p><p>Here you go. A picture is worth a thousand words.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020996_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because not much cloud to shade the sunlight, I did put on sun block almost every other hour if possible. </p><p>Luckily, the temperature was stably around 26 deg C, so it was sort of comfortable.</p><p>This track seems to continue into the desert, I wondered where it will end.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030005_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>There were not many towns or stores along the highway, </p><p>all I could see was desert. The mountain top far far away was showing its snow, </p><p>which was a strong contrast with this hot and dry desert.</p><p>Once a while, some freight trains passed by, and followed by at lest 40 of freight cars.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020925_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was having time of my life riding on this smooth highway, </p><p>and I told myself that I would get off the highway at the first exit I saw. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020974_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I finally got off at QingQuan, and I was very happy when I looked back—no Bike allowed. I knew it!!!</p><p>Well, I did go back to Rt 312 eventually. But the road condition was just as bad as what I encountered this morning. </p><p>I had to walk my Dido, and the road disappeared on me AGAIN.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020976_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Not that I did not want to follow the rules, I was so forced to go back on that smooth highway. </p><p>I felt that I was wasting my time by getting on and off like this, maybe I should just spend the whole day on this nice one. </p><p>Since this was a newly constructed highway, many barriers were not really installed completely yet. </p><p>I could still get on and off the highway through them, if I want to.</p><p> </p><p>A little commercial break:</p><p>These photos were taken to express my gratitude to MSI Computer and Jeff for donating this laptop. </p><p>It allows me to store all the photos, GPS tracking information and record my journal/blog. </p><p>Without this royal laptop, my friend, I can only write my diary on paper, </p><p>and it would be impossible to update it online regularly to share them with all of you.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020967_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>No town, no rest area, I was on the bike the whole day today.</p><p>Even though it was not too hot, it was still tiresome to ride a bike like this. </p><p>I finally saw some gas station, so I stopped to have some juice and catch up my breath.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030003_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because it was upwind almost the whole day, even there was no uphill, still very difficult to keep moving forward.</p><p>The wind is blowing crazy here, I was not surprised at all to see windmills everywhere for generating electricity. </p><p>I estimated there are thousands of them. It was such a magnificent view when they all turn together by the wind.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030034_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is approximately 130 km from Jiayuguan to Yumen. </p><p>I started a bit late today, so I expected I would arrive late, too.</p><p>Fortunately for me, the sun didn't go down until 9:00 around here, I didn't feel pressure to rush at all. </p><p>I finally got off at the exit to Yumen east at around 8:00, and I got caught by the highway patrol, not much happened though. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030037_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Rt. 312 all of a sudden showed up from nowhere, I biked back on it and about half an hour later, I arrived at Yumen city.</p><p>Being exhausted, thirty, and hungry, I checked into a cheap hotel with 15 RMB for one bed in a three-bed room. </p><p>Then I rushed into a restaurant to have my first nice meal for today.</p><p>I ordered fried rice, country-style pork saute, and a bowl of rapeseed tofu soup, delicious and nutritious, had to be nice to myself.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030049_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Back to the hotel, I poured some hot water into the sink,</p><p>cleaned up myself with the warm towel, and I felt relaxed finally.</p><p>It is no big deal not to wash the clothes for one day, but if I don't go to sleep soon, </p><p>I might break my early bird cycle, then THAT would become a big deal very soon…</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030042_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><br /></p>
