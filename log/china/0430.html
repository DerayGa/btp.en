When every one is getting ready for work, I am in Zhengzhou, China, relaxing. </span></p><p>Although I wanted to sleep in, but my biological clock woke me up at 5:00. </p><p>It’s a rare treat to stay in such comfortable room even though it was a little bit more expensive, </p><p>but I felt like I am in a five-star hotel. When I woke up, for a moment, I didn’t know where I was.</p><p><br />There was not much I could do early in the morning. </p><p>So I went downstairs to have for a decent breakfast. The area along the street I was staying is called “Liu Village” . </p><p>There are many hotels and restaurants. When I walked downstairs, I found that the front metal gate was not even opened yet. </p><p>It appeared that I was the first person to wake up this morning. </p><p>When I stretched and yawned, I could smell the breakfast coming from somewhere near by. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000887_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I ordered a bowl of soybean milk and an order of four pan-fried biscuits. </p><p>The biscuits have round shapes with some unidentified fillings. It tasted sweet. </p><p>I wanted to order something looked like small version of fried bread sticks, </p><p>but they were sold by kilogram and that was just too much for me :(</p><p>When the soybean milk came, I had a sip and it was horrible. </p><p>There was no sweetness to it. It tasted more like sour soy milk. </p><p>I saw other people used their spoons to scoop a spoonful of sugar to mix in with their soybean milk so I did the same. </p><p>What a relaxing breakfast. I didn’t have to ride bike and eat breakfast at the same time. </p><p>I didn’t have to munching on the pathetic dry food. Total cost of breakfast was 1.50 RMB, very inexpensive.</p><p> </p><p>In the morning, I brought Dido to the repair shop next to the hotel. </p><p>I tried to use Henan dialect by imitating foreigners speaking Chinese. </p><p>I told the owner that one of the screws in the front rack was loosed. </p><p>There were some wear on the screw so I couldn’t tighten it up. </p><p>Can you weld it shut? So it will be solid. </p><p>Just in case, I asked him to weld all the other 7 screws that were still in tact. </p><p>I don’t think I ride back with these heavy bags on the back if the front rack breaks in the middle of nowhere.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000893_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I asked the owner for an estimate for welding all eight screws. </p><p>I pretended to be poor and had no money and hoped I could get a cheap price.</p><p>And the owner only asked for 2 RMB and that was much cheaper than I expected :D</p><p>I was holding Dido for the owner while he was welding the screws one by one. </p><p>Well, let’s consider this as “destructive maintenance”.</p><p>When I arrive in Paris, how will I take the front rack off the bike to pack before shipping back to Taiwan? </p><p>Oh well, that’s the problem won’t happen until half year later. </p><p>I will worry about it then. It’s more important to fix the problem now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000902_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After finished welding, I borrowed a bucket of water and a towel to clean the dirt off Dido slowly.</p><p>It has only been a week and the bike was covered with a layer of dirt. </p><p>Carefully wiped down, Dido looked more like in its original appearance now.</p><p> </p><p>I have stored my travel logs in iPod and then upload them at Internet cafés. </p><p>It only cost 1 RMB per hour at the cheaper CRT screen area.</p><p>Since there was nothing to do in the morning, I spent two hours there. </p><p>At the same time, I have uploaded travel logs up to 29th. </p><p> </p><p>Today is April 30th and tomorrow is May 1st. In Taiwan, it is a one-day Labor Day holiday. </p><p>But in China, May 1st is the beginning of a long holiday week.</p><p>Everyone in China is traveling, either going home or travel. </p><p>This is a busy and happy week. As long as I will not get stock in traffic tomorrow, that is all that matter :(</p><p> </p><p>At 12:30 pm, rode Dido without all the bags and brought my camera and GPS. </p><p>The plan is to spend an afternoon at Yellow River scenic area. </p><p>I thought the Yellow Riser was close, but ended up I had to ride almost an hour and half, approximately 25 km. </p><p>It’s like from SOGO on Chung Hsiao East Road to the sandwich shop in Keelung . Not close at all :(</p><p> </p><p>Originally I wanted to stop at the entrance. Since bicycles are allowed inside, so I bought a ticket for 30 RMB.</p><p>The ticket indicated this is an AAAA class tourist attraction. </p><p>FOUR A’s! I was so looking forward to it, but very disappointed at the end : ( </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000906_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am going to save everyone 30 RMB. </p><p>Let me be your tour guide and it will only take 5 minutes to tour this four A’s class tourist attraction.</p><p> </p><p>When you first enter, </p><p>you will see gigantic sculptures of Yen and Yellow Emperors (known as the founders of Chinese civilization) sitting on top of stones. </p><p>Are they carved out of stone, I wonder? The lines are a little bit too clean. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000912_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then there is the observation lake.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000929_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are a few dozens of horses that you can pay a couple of RMB to take a picture of riding them.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000916_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are many fishing boats selling fish. Of course the fish are from the Yellow River.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000917_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Don’t know why there is a beat up aircraft. </p><p>Probably it’s for the parents to take pictures of their kids climbing up and down the aircraft.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000925_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is a big square with a platform surrounded with ancient bronze instruments (Maybe???)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000931_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>You can also buy some incense here to pay respects to Chinese ancestors. </p><p>There are many kinds of incense, from regular ones to sizes that are as tall as an adult.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000933_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And that’s all, folks. That is what I spent 30 RMB for T_T</p><p>Give me back my money. I want to buy 30 pineapples on the stick with that money.</p><p>What kind of four A’s class tourist attraction ~"~</p><p>If I have known I would stop at the entrance. Only if I have known. Luckily I only spent 30 RMB. </p><p> </p><p>Back to the hotel and took a nice shower, packed all the bags, tomorrow my journey will start again. </p><p>This time it will be heading toward west. South heading has come to an end. </p><p>Dinner was taking care of at the side streets. I saw some Islamic style baked biscuits. </p><p>It’s freshly made biscuits baked on top of a charcoal fire oven and they looked very crispy and smelled good.</p><p>You can buy them just plain or with fillings. The fillings are stir-fried bean sprouts, </p><p>shredded carrots, diced green onions, and choices of hotdogs or pan-fried eggs. </p><p>Then we can eat with biscuits with the filling inside. </p><p>I can not believe something so delicious costs only 1 RMB. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000943_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought another two of something looks like chicken nuggets on the stick, </p><p>one sausage on a stick, one chicken liver on the stick and total cost just 3 RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000945_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As I was eating and walking back to the hotel, all the sudden a rumble of thunders and the rain started pouring down. </p><p>It was a sunny afternoon, and the weather changed in a split second.</p><p>Luckily it was a quick shower; otherwise, riding bike in the rain would be very uncomfortable @"@</p><p><br /></p>
