										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-4_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">There are less chicken here so the clucking power is weak but I still woke up before six. </span></p><p>I opened the door and stretched myself right when the owner with a yellow safety helmet walked by on his way to work. </p><p>So I quickly paid him 10bucks for the night and asked for a keg of water to fill my water bottles for the day.</p><p> </p><p>I packed my sleeping bag and as usually I checked Dido for loose nuts and the racks then I fill up its tires. </p><p>Even I wake up before six, </p><p>but if I do this routine everyday my departure time is always as late as thirty minutes after seven. </p><p>I have to accustom myself to wake up as early as four thirty so I can leave before six. </p><p>The air is cooler in the early morning and I won’t be under the sun for a whole day like today. </p><p>I almost fainted. </p><p> </p><p>I left a little gift in open air latrine on this cold early morning. </p><p>The basic things being a human, to eat, to drink, to stool, to urinate and to sleep it’s as easy as said and done.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000594_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After about half hour of my departure I ate the cookies I bought at “Fortune Convenient Store” yesterday. </p><p>I am left without emergency provision, or should I say snacks, after I finished the cookies.</p><p> </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000598_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A half hour later I stopped by the “Happy Eastern Grocery Store” to get some provisions. </p><p>I saw something like walnut cookies so I asked the owner how much it costs. </p><p>“5 bucks”. </p><p>I immediately reacted with a “too expensive” expression on my face. </p><p>5 per cookie? </p><p>Now that’s very expensive. </p><p>Well it was actually 5 bucks per 500 grams. </p><p> </p><p>In China everything sells by the weight instead of units. </p><p>So I took 4 piece of those cookies which cost me 4 bucks </p><p>and I bought two envelop of corn flavored milk (1.5 each), because I wanted to drink milk.</p><p>At all it cost me 12 bucks. I paid with a one hundred bill and got 88 of change back. </p><p>This will allow me to have fun buying things for a few days.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000601_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So I finished breakfast riding in order to catch up on the journey. </p><p>Since I left Beijing I embarrassingly got lost so I want to get to Baoding in one day. </p><p>I plan to ride from Yi County to Laishui County and then to Gaobeidian City. </p><p>If I do this then I will only loose one day from my “lost journey”. </p><p>There’s some pleasure getting lost. </p><p>I could enjoy the great scenes in the mountain even though it was a hard up hill right but it was well worth it.</p><p>  </p><p>The road I took this morning was big and smooth. </p><p>There were stores or farmlands along the way. </p><p>I gained some speed but at the same time it was tiring.</p><p> </p><p>I rode so fast that I arrived at Gaobeidian city at ten thirty even though I planned to get here in the afternoon. </p><p>I should celebrate since the 107 National Freeway which is the way I should have taken reappeared. </p><p>Now I am back on track!</p><p>  </p><p>I will head south on 107 National Freeway, </p><p>pass by a few large cities along the way then make a turn and I will be in Xian. </p><p>Now I believe that I can ride easily and get to Xian according to my plan in two weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Once I connected with the 107 freeway the roads transformed into big avenues. </p><p>There are about five lanes in each direction, that’s how big it is.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000609_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But of course the downside is that trucks are abundant. </p><p>The drivers seem to speak with their horn. </p><p>According to the way and the frequency they use the horn I can translate them into:</p><p>“Hey get off of my way you asshole!”</p><p>“Watch it! Your daddy is coming through.”</p><p>“What are you doing riding around with a bike. Are you bored?”</p><p>“Hi there~ How are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Well, yes there are few that salute you with a clang. </p><p>Comparing to those trucks they are much nicer. </p><p>But having someone clang at you, when you are riding bike it certainly feels awful. </p><p>So now, I learned to be polite. </p><p>Every time someone clangs at me I will just put up my left hand and show the respect with my middle finger.</p><p> </p><p>I also saw an entire army going through shaking the National Freeway. </p><p>First it was the heavy infantry with tanks and then the rocket launchers passed by.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000603_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I don’t know if those soldiers standing in the middle of the street </p><p>had something to do with the infantry that just passed by. </p><p>But they don’t seem like controlling the traffic and they just stand there like statues. </p><p>Poor them, the sun is so strong that I am almost fainting.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000607_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sun is so strong that if I stop to rest and remove my butt from the seat for 10 seconds and then seat back, </p><p>I will feel a burning sensation. </p><p> </p><p>I feel evaporated exactly at 12 o’clock at noon. </p><p>I drank enough water and two envelop of milk how come I still felt so thirty. </p><p>Choosing a place to eat depends on your feelings. </p><p>Today I felt chemistry between this fruit stand and me so I stopped and put Dido under shade.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000616_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I chose a watermelon. The owner reminded me that it’s yellow meat. </p><p>Yellow or red doesn’t matter to me I just want her to chop it open and I will eat it to hydrate myself.</p><p>The watermelon cost 9 bucks and weighted about 2 kilogram. </p><p>In Taiwan I can only buy a cup of watermelon juice with the same price. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000617_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The owner pulled a chair and gave it to me. </p><p>She instructed me to sit under a big umbrella. It was nice to be away of the sun for a while. </p><p>I slowly finished the watermelon by myself. </p><p>I believe that’s enough to hydrate me. </p><p>Next to the fruit stand there’s a food stand they have a bucket of water and tower </p><p>for customer to wash their hands before eating. </p><p>So I asked to wash my hand there. </p><p>I didn’t dare to use the tower but I rubbed my face with the clean water. It sure felt good.</p><p>  </p><p>The owner of this stand was cooking pancake.</p><p>I asked if there’s any filling to this pancake. </p><p>It was filled with chopped barbequed donkey meat. </p><p>Watching others eat, it looked like delicious so I bought three of them, one each. It’s very cheap.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000620_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am always asked if I want some beer with my meal. </p><p>Beer here in China is very cheap, two or three bucks per bottle and it taste good. </p><p>But since I have to get going I didn’t buy it. </p><p> </p><p>I finished my lunch riding just like my breakfast. </p><p>The barbequed donkey tastes like a mix of salt preserved meat with barbequed pork. </p><p>It’s balanced in fat and meat and very juicy. </p><p>It’s so good and cheap that once I took the first bite I wanted to go back and buy more.</p><p>  </p><p>About 10 minutes to one in the afternoon I suddenly felt dizzy. </p><p>My head felt like someone wrapped my head with cotton and put a rubber band around it. </p><p>I believe it’s because I didn’t rest for the whole day.</p><p> </p><p>I think I was about to have a heatstroke. </p><p>I don’t have to prove myself anything so I rode to a gas station along the way and hide myself under shade. </p><p>I took off my jacket and peer off my babushka, dropped my sunglasses and opened my cloth’s zipper. </p><p>I lay on the stairs and rested. </p><p>The clerk came out and asked me what I wanted I told him that I just want to get away from the sun so he left me.</p><p> </p><p>I felt dizzy and sleepy laying there so I hold my bike and took a one hour nap. </p><p>I felt much better after the nap. The sun is less irritating around two in the afternoon. </p><p>I woke up put sun block on my face and my calf and continued riding.</p><p> </p><p>After a while I saw a toll both. Did I get lost again and went on a highway? </p><p>Why there’s a toll both?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000622_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Actually the National Freeway also collected toll but it’s free for bicycles. </p><p>I passed the toll both and went to buy a cold drink to reward myself for riding under the irritating sun. </p><p>I bought a can of what supposed to be coke and tasted like coke which cost 2.5 bucks. </p><p>After I consumed half of the can I realized that it actually wasn’t Coca Cola it was called “Future Cola” </p><p>produced by “WAHAHA GROUP”. </p><p> </p><p>I swear that everything I say is true if not I won’t be able to drink the real Coca Cola never in my life.</p><p>(Website of WAHAHA added by H2 <a href="http://future.en.wahaha.com.cn/softdrinking.shtml" target="_blank">http://future.en.wahaha.com.cn/softdrinking.shtml</a>)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000623_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I don’t dare to ride away from 107 National Freeway just in case I get lost. </p><p>I will just head south accordingly.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000627_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I saw a eight years old girl doing homework at the door steps of a hotel,so decided to stay here for tonight. </p><p>It cost 20 bucks and it is far better room than yesterday’s filthy room. </p><p>It is a regular hotel with clean blankets.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000632-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since it was still early, so I decided to wash my three day laundry </p><p>which included my dirty jacket, dirty shorts, dirty dry tex shirt, dirty babushka, dirty gloves and dirty socks. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000636-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The owner gave me a big red bucket. </p><p>There was detergent so I didn’t have to use my soap. </p><p>I washed them quickly and hanged them when the sun was still up. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000639-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I also collected a bucket of well water and bath myself and washed my head. </p><p>After three days of bike journey I felt like I washed away every dirty of me. </p><p> </p><p>Not long after I checked in the hotel an elder biker also checked in. </p><p>His last name is Yang from Chongqing. </p><p>He was riding from there to Beijing. He rode 1900Km in just 15 days. </p><p>I asked his age and unbelievably he is sixty years old. </p><p>He definitely was very energetic. </p><p>I noticed that he only carried a bottle with a straw and two bags on the rack.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000640-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>His tires were all patched up but he kept using them and rode for almost 2000Km. </p><p>He will get to Beijing tomorrow which means he will only spend one day to get there. </p><p>I didn’t dare to tell him that I spent three days to get here. </p><p>It was too embarrassing.</p><p> </p><p>After settling down I went out with my shorts and sleeveless shirt to find dinner. </p><p>It was kind of cold to go further away as the owner indicated me </p><p>so I decided to eat right at the door where a newly installed red sign said </p><p>“GRILL”. “I will have this” I told the owner and ordered a serving. </p><p>One serving included one hot dog, one pork meat, one lamb, one beef, one chicken heart and one grilled skin. </p><p>Everything was sprayed with a little special spice. </p><p>Once I took a bite I couldn’t stop.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000641-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The owner told me that tomorrow is their inauguration and that they were grilling it for themselves today. </p><p>But since I wanted to eat so I became their first customer. </p><p>It was delicious so I ordered 2 more pork, lamb and hot dog. </p><p>I was still hungry after that so the owner took out white bun and grilled it. </p><p>I didn’t know that can be grilled.</p><p> </p><p>It was crispy after grilled with some spice sprayed on top it tasted very good. </p><p>And finally I was full. Suddenly I realized that I ordered and ate a bunch of stuffs.</p><p> </p><p>I was wondering how much it will cost me. “7.50 bucks, just give 7.”</p><p>Really that cheap? I ate a lot. I don’t want you to go bankrupt before inauguration. </p><p>Well, I took my big round belly back to my room drink some tea. </p><p>After I brush my teeth I will be able to sleep early today. </p><p>Being able to find a place early to spend the night it’s a very neat thing to do.</p><p><br /></p>
