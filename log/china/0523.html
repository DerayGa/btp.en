										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-32_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Last night, I checked into the hotel and thought I was going to stay for one night only.</span></p><p>This morning, I saw the weather was so nice, so I started to plan a trip to the Great Wall of China.</p><p>The hotel owner asked, "You are going to stay here one more night, right?"</p><p>"Huh? I am, but how do YOU know?" I asked myself.</p><p>He reminded me that it would be a windy day, up to Force 7, so I might have trouble riding a bike today.</p><p>I just realized that too sunny, too rainy, now even too windy, are all the factors I should consider when riding a bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020735_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went outside, WOW! It was REALLY windy. </p><p>The boy in "The education of a little tree" said that when he was young, he was so light that he could fly with the wind.</p><p>Judging from this windy situation, I believed with a piece of bed sheet, I can also fly with the wind.</p><p>Anyway, the first thing I needed to do today was not to "eat", but to check my website situation.</p><p> </p><p>Without proper notice or explanation, Bluehost closed my website, and canceled my domain name. </p><p>They just asked me to contact the customer service department via e-mail.</p><p>I couldn't even log into my account. So I registered a new account and demanded an explanation at this internet café.</p><p>What I got was auto-reply from Bluehost saying that someone will look into my account during normal business hour.</p><p>I was so angry and frustrated about their attitude. I pre-paid three years' service fee, for almost 6000 NTD, and this was what I got? </p><p> </p><p>Finally, I received their reply the next morning, which made me even more frustrated. </p><p>First of all, they should write me an e-mail or notify me about any abnormal activities of my account. </p><p>They shouldn't just shut my web site off, stopped my account and expected me to find an alternative way to contact them.</p><p>Basically, they closed my web site because somebody reported illegal activities on my website.</p><p>This answer only confused me even more, and I had no idea what they were talking about.</p><p> </p><p>Good news was, they replied my e-mail within 30 min, saying that those Mac Chinese softwares were illegal, </p><p>and that was the reason they decided to shut off my web site immediately—meaning without notification.</p><p>Well, I had no idea why they were OK before, but now was not, about my Chinese Mac downloads. </p><p>I had no energy to fight with them at this moment, so I just took all the downloads off the site at this moment. </p><p>Let me say sorry to those Mac users that might need these softwares. I would make them available once I find a new home for them.</p><p> </p><p>Enough of the hassles, it was about time for lunch.</p><p>I ordered a beef casserole, and a piece of flatbread.</p><p>The casserole dish had shredded seaweed, some mushrooms, vegetables, cellophane noodles, </p><p>and sliced stewed beef, accompanied with a delectable soup.</p><p>Even I saw some sand-like stuff at the bottom of that pot, I still couldn't control myself but finished the very last drop of that soup.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020740_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The plan for this afternoon? </p><p>"I am going to the Great Wall of China!" Oh! Yeah!</p><p>Carrying two packs of crackers, one pack of peanuts, Dido and I started our field trip together.</p><p>It cost 5 RMB to buy a map, very expensive to me, so I decided to take advantage of my own mouth—ask for directions.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020748_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As usual, I got lost a little bit, but eventually I arrived at the Jiayuguan (Jiayu Pass)—</p><p>also called the " First and Greatest Pass Under Heaven".</p><p>As everybody knows, Jiayuguan is the west end of the Great Wall, </p><p>so it was always heavily guarded by the military since the ancient China, </p><p>to prevent the attack by Xiongnu (some nomadic people from central Asia in ancient China).</p><p>Many years later, you can still see military units here.</p><p>I saw many tanks running in the desert when I was riding my bike on the way here.</p><p>These soldiers were running under the sun. I wonder where they were heading.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020891_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because the entrance fee for Jiangyu Guan was 61 RMB, and it was rated 4-star, I had no interest whatsoever to get in. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020759_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Remembered that I paid 30 RMB to enter a 4-star tourist site nearby the Yellow River? </p><p>That was totally waste of my money.</p><p>More importantly, bike was not allowed here. </p><p>But I can't park Dido at the parking lot, which was 5 cents, since I didn't bring the lock with me, either.</p><p>Therefore…. </p><p>Yes, I have been at the "First and Greatest Pass Under Heaven"……'s gate.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020761_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I leaned on the fence, and looked inside, "Ohhh.. THAT is the Great Wall".</p><p>I was still debating if I should pay the money and get in, </p><p>I was wondering if I will regret later that I was so close to the Great Wall but didn't get close enough to walk on it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020769_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I needed time to rethink this over, so I walked and walked, and I walked into the Black Mountain (Hei Shan) Rock painting area.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020781_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking at these strange rocks, some were human sculptures marked with years they were made. Some had drawings on them.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020811_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There was a Great Wall-styled shopping mall around this park. </p><p>Me? Of course just window shopping. </p><p>All I could think at this moment was, should I or should I not pay that stupid money and get on the Great Wall.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020814_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just when I started to have serious headache coming, I saw a map, saying "Overhanging Great Wall". </p><p>Wow! Even the name sounds so cool. With an ice popsicle in my mouth, I rushed over on my Dido.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020829_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>"Overhanging Great Wall" is also A Great Wall, but the entrance fee was only 21 RMB, which was 40 RMB cheaper than the previous one. </p><p>The whole package was just too attractive to me.</p><p>The cashier even offered to keep an eye on my Dido while I toured the Great Wall. I was really touched.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020831_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Today is Wed, no tour bus brought in tons of people here. </p><p>This part of Great Wall was smaller, and didn't have the shopping center, so actually not many locals visiting, either.</p><p>I started to walk on the wall around 1:30, and looped back at 3:00, and I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE WALL. </p><p>This was the best tour I have ever had. It felt like being those rich people, who spent lots of money to reserve this part of Great Wall just for them. </p><p>Now with only 21 RMB, I also had this part of Great Wall all by myself.</p><p>I was totally thrilled.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020845_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This was the view from the bottom, and you will pass two beacons when climbing up.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020853_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I started slow (need to catch my breathe), and still not on the top yet ~_~</p><p>I was told that there were two foreigners spent almost six months to walk on the entire Great Wall, 5000 km long. </p><p>They are really some tough people.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020861_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The recovery of the Great Wall was a delicate and difficult job. But it was so nicely done, </p><p>that you get to step on the same material that was used thousand years ago to build this Great Wall.</p><p>Even the poles for the flags were made of thin bamboo stick. Their effort to recover this piece of history deeply touched my heart.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020877_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Walk slowly, I saw another "piece" of the Great Wall. For some reason, the Great Wall is not a continuous long wall anymore, </p><p>it was a piece here, and another piece there. Same for the entrance ticket, </p><p>you have to buy one for each piece of the Great Wall that you want to visit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020876_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was pretty windy on the ground, and it was worse when I got on this Great Wall. </p><p>The higher I climbed, the stronger the wind was. </p><p>I might be able to fly like a kite if some one just gave me a bed sheet now.</p><p>Finally, I reached the highest beacon at the Overhanging Great Wall, and this was the end point for this part of the Great Wall. </p><p>After this, was the Great Wall made by the Mother Nature.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020873_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Hou WenYong, a popular author in Taiwan, once said "We see challenge, we march there".</p><p>With the same attitude, I risked my life to climb down the beacon to the other side, the "Mother Nature Great Wall". </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020883_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looked at the path I just walked, WOW! And don't forget that I still needed to make it back to the beacon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020886_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since I took the dangerous path to come here, might as well take a photo to mark this historical moment.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020888_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looked down from the beacon, the greens below my feet really were like the oasis in a colossal desert area.</p><p>The trees lined up at each side of the road around here now looked like green lines that extended to the city.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020889_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The same analogy, these modern cities like Weiwu, Changyi, Jiuquan, and Jiayuguan, </p><p>were also like oasis cities that surround the desert.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020875_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The views of looking up to the Great Wall from the bottom, </p><p>and looking down to the oasis from the Great Wall, were so dramatically different. </p><p>Embracing the cold breeze on this sunny day, </p><p>I was wondering what those soldiers saw when they were defending their country in the ancient China. </p><p>Was the night cold? It can't be an easy job to take the night shift in the army, </p><p>no matter which dynasty they lived in, right?</p><p> </p><p>I sat here to enjoy the scenery for a long time.</p><p>The purpose of building the Great Wall was to protect China from the attack by Xiongnu, therefore, </p><p>it made a better sense to build the wall along the existing mountains. </p><p>That is why many parts of the Great Wall were sort of blended into the mountains around them.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020868_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was a bit hungry on the way back to the city, </p><p>so I was really excited to see the interesting deep-fried chicken stand that I tried yesterday. </p><p>I got some veggie-roll, hot dogs, fish balls, stinky tofu, regular tofu--all on the sticks, </p><p>and the golden needle mushroom that was in my mouth at this moment.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020894_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Their sauce and seasoning powers were really tasty, I could smell it long before I can see that stand.</p><p>It only cost me 4 RMB for all these. I was so happy to eat them on my bike thatI didn't notice I dropped something on the stand . </p><p>(Hint: there was a black little stuff on the upper right hand corner).</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020893_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>By time I was back to the hotel, changed the clothes and ready to sort my photos, I finally noticed that I can't find my GPS tracker. </p><p>It was not on my left hand, where I usually held it that way, it was not in my pocket. So where was it?</p><p> </p><p>The last time I saw that GPS tracker was by that food stand. </p><p>I had to take the photo and eat the food at the same time, so I left my GPS tracker on that stand. </p><p>Then I just left, with my food, but not that tracker.</p><p>Oh! My god! It has been more than half an hour already. </p><p>Still wearing my PJs and slippers, I rode Dido back to that stand as fast as I can.</p><p>I hope nobody would take it, otherwise I won't be able to track my path.</p><p>Usually I turn it on in the morning, turn it off when I arrive to a hotel at night. </p><p>I never pay much attention to it, but it was always doing its job without any complain. </p><p>"I am so sorry for leaving you out there. Please stay at the same place. I am coming for you ASAP".</p><p> </p><p>It was around 50 m away from that stand, the unique smell told me that I was almost there. </p><p>I almost cried when I didn't see my GPS tracker on the stand. </p><p>The lady took it out from her cart and told me that she it was too late to grab me back when she saw that on her stand. </p><p>So she moved it inside her cart to keep it safe.</p><p>"Thank you so much, nice lady! I really appreciate it" </p><p>I thanked her so many times that made her feel a bit embarrassed, so I thought I should go then.</p><p> </p><p>My hat was blown away, so I had to find another hat that can shade the sun when necessary.</p><p>The hotel I stayed was probably on the most crowded street in Jiayuguan city. </p><p>The traditional market and breakfast stands started their business in the morning, other food stands came in around noon. </p><p>Grocery shopping stalls joined in the afternoon. </p><p>Then the restaurants and night markets replaced all other activities to occupy the entire street.</p><p>I saw a jean-material baseball cap, maybe this would work just fine for me.</p><p>It was 5 RMB, but I bargained it down to 4, excellent price.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020895_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was still pretty bright at 8:00 at night, but it can't fool my tummy. </p><p>So I went to hunt for dinner at "the most crowded street of Jiayuguan"</p><p>Because most of them sold the same type of food: beef in the clay pot, lamb in the clay pot, </p><p>or chicken in the clay pot, with the same price, 6 RMB. The only difference would be the taste.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020909_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I sat down in a relatively clean restaurant (actually I judged by how the boss looks like), </p><p>and ordered a chicken in the clay pot. The sizzling hot pot was heated on the coal until it's ready.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020902_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After serving on the table, the clay pot continued the soup boiling for a while.</p><p>Adding some meshed garlic paste and hot pepper, accompanied by free flatbread,</p><p>this one tasted way better than the one I had for lunch today.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020906_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I will be out of Jiayuguan tomorrow, that means less grocery stores and less food stands.</p><p>I had to stock my snacks, so I went shopping at the same store I went yesterday.</p><p>I knew I will miss all the convenient stores, restaurants, hotels and ice-pop stands. </p><p>I would have to adjust my life without them.</p><p>I liked peanuts, so I bought 5 packs of different flavors of sweet peanuts, it should last for a while.</p><p>I also got some maltose-sweetened milk, a roll of tissue, </p><p>and a Sachima (Note: a Manchu sweet snack, main ingredient is flour, butter and rock sugar).</p><p>When I was at the cashier, the owner said to me very seriously, </p><p>"I have to remind you that there are a lot of thieves at this area. You'd better take very good care of your personal belongs."</p><p> </p><p>So, the most crowded street also has the most crowded thieves?</p><p>They'd take anything, from wallets to scooters, and they ran away, beyond, out of the Great Wall. What can you do then?</p><p>"How about the police? Can they do something about it?"</p><p>She gave me a smile, and said those polices were all bribed, </p><p>so don't expect much. We can only take good care of ourselves.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1020911_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Since then, I only had enough money and a notebook (not the laptop) with me if I came out for dinners and stuff. </p><p>That's why I didn't have many photos taken at the dinner place or at night.</p><p>I remembered earlier when I carelessly took out my digital camera while waiting for the dinner. </p><p>That might qualify me as an easy target for "them", how dangerous!</p><p>I was pretty lucky, I guess, except the adventure to get my GPS tracker back.</p><p> </p><p>Thinking about tomorrow, I am going outside of the Great Wal</p><p>l (in ancient China, it meant you go out of the civilized Chinese area that was governed by the emperor).</p><p>I was very excited and very nervous.</p><p>Indulge me! Show me what the real desert is! </p><p><br /></p>
