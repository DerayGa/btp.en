They tasted fine and money was not wasted.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010734_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The hill climbing begun at north of TianShui, 1000m above sea level, and all the way up to 1600m above sea level.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010736_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I propped Dido against a roadside pole and took some pictures. </p><p>When I was thinking if a tripod needed for taking self-portrait,</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010751_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dido slid a bit</p><p>NO” I shouted</p><p>By the time I grabbed the rear bags, it had detached from Dido. </p><p>My poor Dido and the front bags fell down to the wheat field, 3 meters below the roadway.</p><p>Oh! My God, Dido turned upside down. Was it damaged?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010752_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I carefully slid down to the wheat field, removed the front bags, and hauled Dido and myself back to the roadway.</p><p>“It will be nice if someone can give me a hand now” I was thinking</p><p>I slid down again for the front bags and ran back real quick.</p><p>Dido got dirt on it, no damage though. I apologized to Dido.</p><p> </p><p>The front bags got dirt on them as well but I did not clean them well purposely. </p><p>It would be a blessing of disguise for me because I looked poorer with dirty bags. </p><p>When I re-attached the bags back on Dido, I promised that I won’t leave Dido more than 3 steps away when taking pictures.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010753_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After climbing over the first hilltop, the second one had awaited me.</p><p>“How many hills do I have to climb today?” I thought</p><p>When I reached the second hilltop and was ready for a downhill ride, the road did not descend. </p><p>I rode up to a flat plateau of 1600m above sea level. </p><p>The ridge road on the plateau was above the terraced rice fields on both sides, and the far-away mountains were in cloud and mist. </p><p>I enjoyed the breathtaking scenery along the ridge!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010779_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>As a biker, my hard work was rewarded with the spectacular scenery</p><p>It was pretty cool in mountains, probably 16 ~ 18 degree Celsius. </p><p>With the strong crosswind from my right, 130 kg (Dido, me and bags) did not matter. I still rode unsteadily from side to side.</p><p>If we fell off of the ridge, it could be very nasty and worse than Dido’s previous fall.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010794_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the ridge, flying bugs disappeared, instead, wingless insects such as centipede and caterpillar appeared. </p><p>Not sure why they made the effort to cross the road, I did not want Dido to run over the harmless bugs, so I avoided them.</p><p> </p><p>The ridge road was flat. Without up and down, the ride was quite easy. </p><p>It was a right decision not to take busy main roads but local roads. Moreover, the road condition was not as bad as I thought.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010787_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had my lunch at a little town named YunShan in mountains where many houses were made with mudbrick and roof tiles.</p><p>I ordered braised noodle in a restaurant, then went to get a drink on street.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010814_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Juice cups, one for 50 cents RMB, out of curiosity, I bought two cups.</p><p>The first taste reminded me of childhood. It tasted just like the cheap juice tubes sold at the front gates of grade schools. </p><p>The juice tub was simply sugar water with drops of food color in a plastic tube, one for one NT. As a child I loved the juice tube.</p><p>The memorable food probably can not be found in Taiwan anymore. Surprisingly, they were sold here, a little town in China.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010815_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I loaded up on snacks, one kg of hardtracks for four RMB, 20 bags of mini crackers for two RMB.</p><p>Then, my noodle was served. I accompanied Dido and enjoyed the noodle at the front door of the restaurant. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, the granddaughter of a cold noodle stand owner came back home with two test papers, scored 100 and 99, in her hand.</p><p>People here spoke dialect; therefore, I could not understand their conversation.</p><p>School system here teaches both dialect and Mandarin, and focuses on dialect. Promoting dialect is a good thing.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010823_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I took a nap after lunch then set off at 1:00PM</p><p> </p><p>It was very quiet in mountains, farmers’ tractors or commuter buses passed by occasionally.</p><p>Most of the time, I was the only person riding on the road, </p><p>if I stopped, the world became silent, the earth seemed to stop rotating, and everything turned into a picture.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010824_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After riding on the ridge road for another 20 KM, I started descending a steep slope into my first stop, Qingjiazhuang.</p><p>I bought an ice pop, confirmed the direction, and then set off - a real quick stop. </p><p>I could not adjust myself from serenity to uproar and wanted to go back to mountains eagerly.</p><p> </p><p>For the next stop, I was told that the roads were in high mountains behind my back and I probably won’t make it there today by bicycle.</p><p>A young man on his red motorcycle showed me another road. </p><p>Even though the alternative was easier, it was still an uphill ride.</p><p>Bikes were allowed on this highway-like road which went to TianShui as well. </p><p>I could have taken this road this morning instead, and did not have to climb hard in mountains. </p><p>In a way, this road was as boring as other major main roads, trucks roared on the road, and nothing to enjoy.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010842_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I spent 3 hours climbing the 25 KM uphill with 600m elevation gain. </p><p>I can easily finish 25K within one hour on a flat road. </p><p>I started worrying if I could make it to the next stop before sunset, otherwise, I would have to ride in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>A truck check point was on the high point of the road. </p><p>As long as I quietly walk through the check point, policemen usually did not stop me. </p><p>This time, the policeman waved his hand and stopped me. Not sure what happened, </p><p>I was about to show my “Taiwanese ID for China”. The policeman simply felt for me, </p><p>helping me fill my bottles and letting me rest for a while after the strenuous climbing. </p><p>Alright, no trouble, I took a photo of the policeman as a souvenir. </p><p>In China, GonAn (public safety) has been renamed to policeman.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010844_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The condition seemed better after passing the check point, more flat roads and downhills. </p><p>However, when I descended to 1500m above sea level with 100m elevation loss, the downhill ended. </p><p>I continued on climbing again. Hopefully, the sun could work overtime for me today. </p><p>At 8:00pm sharp, TongWei was finally in sight. When I got off the road, the sun went down.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010849_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I found a hostel with room rate 10 RMB for one night. Rooms were sold out except for a double bed room where a journalist had checked in. </p><p>I took the room and had the hostel clerk watch Dido and bags for me while I left for dinner.</p><p>My dinner were twice cooked pork, noodle, and egg soup, half way through dinner, </p><p>I started feeling stomach upset, dizzy and nausea.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010855_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I felt that if I kept eating I would be in danger of losing my life. </p><p>I stopped and paid the bill. When I left the restaurant, I walked like a drunk.</p><p>The hostel was only 100 meters away from the restaurant. </p><p>I had to sit down and rest for five minutes halfway before walking back to the hostel.</p><p> </p><p>The possible causes of my sickness were cheap juices at noon, exhaustion from over-biking, </p><p>having too much wind in mountains, venomous bugs, or food poisoning</p><p> </p><p>The young hostel owner, a new father, was very nice to me because he had seen many bikers like me traveling to XinJiang. </p><p>When he saw I looked pale, walked wobbly, and held my belly, he asked what happened,</p><p>I said I had stomach upset, felt cold, and seemed to have food poisoning.</p><p>He gave me a bag of brown sugar to make hot brown sugar water, </p><p>which should warm up my stomach. I doubted it at first, however, after drinking a big glass of hot brown sugar water, I did feel better.</p><p> </p><p>It was insane to overdo myself for 150 KM strenuous riding in mountains. </p><p>If possible, I really wanted to sleep through the entire day to fully recover from exhaustion.</p><p>p.s. did not take a shower back to back (evil smile)</p><p><br /></p>
