										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-12_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">While I was leaving Luoyang city, a guy in his seventies who was on his bike to work, asked me where I was headed to today. </span></p><p>He said that he had biked from here to Xian, it was all uphill pedaling, very tough.</p><p>"No problem! "Whatever goes up must come down", I will be having a great time when I bike downhill then", I replied. </p><p>He smiled at me, and wished me luck.</p><p> </p><p>I finally realized his mysterious smile--- at the end of the day. </p><p>I was definitely right about "whatever goes up must come down". </p><p>The only problem was, most of the time, TODAY, I was pedaling UP. </p><p>Overall, the route was about 4/5 uphill and 1/5 downhill. I was so exhausted.</p><p> </p><p>I had to put on my face mask, which was part of my Desert Gear, today. </p><p>I decided that I have had enough of the dust raised from those crazy trucks and tractors for the past coupe of days. </p><p>Not to mention the nasty gnats flying into my nose to volunteer becoming part of the yucky mucus these days. </p><p>I just had to protect my face and my nose, RIGHT NOW.</p><p> </p><p>This is what I look like: with my head wrap, sunglasses, and face mask. </p><p>Bet I can drag quite an attention if I show up like this in the bank???</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010189_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Like I said at the very beginning, it was an "uphill day". </p><p>Whole day long, endlessly, I was climbing UP, UP, and UP, just like riding on the famous Suao Hualien Highway in Taiwan.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010207_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Uphill has no sympathy to the people biking on it. I had to take care myself, I had to find FOOD. </p><p>All I had left at this time was two jins (1 Jin is approximately 1.1 pound) of the "brick" biscuits, I need more. </p><p>As soon as I entered this grocery store, I gulped up 600 ml of milk. </p><p>I also bought one jin of suncake-like biscuits (8 of them), and a bag of candy for my snack. </p><p> </p><p>Interestingly, I have noticed that everything in this store was covered with a layer of dust, </p><p>I wondered that was because of the windy situation in this area or---nobody ever came to this store??? </p><p>Well, I know I will not trust the expiration date label—IF there is one, anyway. </p><p>I am sure everything here has an expiration date of 100 years, I will take my chances.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010213_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Eating the yummy suncake and riding on my bike, I continued the endless "moving up" adventure. </p><p>I don't mind the climbing that much anymore, but I really can't take the stinky smell filled in the air when I was passing somewhere. </p><p>What was THAT??? It didn't smell like any of the fertilizer for those crops. Maybe decomposition of some sort? </p><p>It was really disgusting. Even with my mask on, I had to hold my breath and pedaled as fast as I can. </p><p>After a while, I inhaled a tiny little bit of the air to make sure that stinky smell had gone, then I finally got to breath normally.</p><p> </p><p>After finishing my fried rice lunch at Yima, I sat outside of that restaurant, having some tea and keeping my Dido company. </p><p>A little kid, who looked like 5-6 years old, came to stare at me. </p><p>I offered some candy to him, but he just ran away after I asked several times. </p><p>He probably thought I was a weirdo? A couple of minutes later, the kid came back on his own tricycle, showing me "See what I have?"</p><p> </p><p>3:00 pm. A local gas station. Enjoy my popsicle.</p><p>It was just an ordinary popsicle, just made of water and sugar, but… man.. How can it be so delicious?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010198_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While I was enjoy my popsicle, the family worked in the gas station decided to have some conversation with me. </p><p>"Do you mind some company on the way to Urumuqi?" the Dad asked. </p><p>"It is not a good idea, because I got lost very often." I replied. </p><p>For some reason, the father interpreted my reply as a "YES". </p><p>So he asked his two sons to get the bikes out, and told them to take on adventure with me.</p><p> </p><p>WAIT A MINUTE!!! NO KIDDING!!! I just stopped by to have some popsicless, please don't reward me with two little kids.</p><p>It was such a blast to sit in the shade and eating popsicles, compared to mountain biking under the sun, I was totally in heaven. </p><p>To extend my "happy hour", literally, I finished totally 4 popsicles, one after another. Then, well, time to go.</p><p> </p><p>How interesting! I saw many doors IN the mountain. I wondered how they did that. </p><p>Did they really dig into the mountain and live there?Wish I can tour some of them somehow someday.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010212_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am guessing the humidity is really low, I didn't sweat much at all during the past couple of days, and it was quite comfortable. </p><p>However, my knees felt the opposite. Finally, after almost 100 km of uphill, </p><p>the road turned to mostly downhill right before I approached Sanmenxia.</p><p> </p><p>Just when I was leaving the mountainous area, a white van slowed down and waited for me. </p><p>A young guy asked me some typical questions like "Where are you from?", "Where are you going?" etc. </p><p>Afterwards, unbelievably, he gave me a cold beer. </p><p>Wow! The very first time that somebody rooted for me AND gave me a beer. What a treat!</p><p> </p><p><br />I thanked and waved them goodbye, still overwhelming what just happened. </p><p>Then, "I should've asked if they have soda instead", I thought. I gulped the beer.</p><p> </p><p>The first sign I saw after entering Sanmenxia was on a HOTEL.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010224_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went in to check the rate immediately. The owner said "30 RMB", I thanked him and left. </p><p>He grabbed me back and dropped the price to 20 RMB. </p><p>I didn't like his attitude at all, but my legs were really sore from the "mountain biking" today. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010222_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Well, at least it was a clean room, with water to wash my clothes, outlet to plug in my gears, not too bad, really.</p><p>I was hoping to taste some local delight tonight, but obviously there was none. </p><p>So I fed my empty stomach with some pork/pickled mustard noodle soup at the next door.</p><p> </p><p>I remembered the guy at the gas station saying I would be finishing half of my tour by the time I entered Xian—IF my destination was Urumuqi. </p><p>For real, from Beijing to Xian, is hardly 1/3 or even ¼ of my total trip planned in China. Still have a long way to go.</p><p>This hotel was facing the train station; </p><p>I can hear every single word from the PA system announcing the time and destination of each train. </p><p>It was non-stopping from 9:00 pm to mid-night; this station was really that busy?</p><p> </p><p>Probably for the same reason, people checked in almost every hour after mid-night, </p><p>and I was woken up every single time by the noise they were making. </p><p>I stared at my watch and wondered how much time did I have left to sleep ZZZZZ</p><p> </p><p>Thinking of those scrumptious sugar popsicles I had today, I can't believe how happy I was from just five cents!</p><p><br /></p>
