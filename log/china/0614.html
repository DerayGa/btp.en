The cashier asked for my ID, I told her the only thing I had with me was my passport. </p><p>Immediately, she knew I was looking for my Taiwan credit card. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050958_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I filled a form, signed my name, I gave my credit card a big “welcome home” hug. </p><p>I would really need this card later on when I entered Europe.</p><p>The fee for cash advance was way too high here, I would wait for the money that Misasa wired to me later.</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Bai came to look for me after I went back to the hotel. </p><p>He was in charged of the sales for MSI (Micro-Star International) at Xinjiang branch. </p><p>He helped me tremendously when I was here, including receiving packages from Taiwan, sending packages to Taiwan. </p><p>Even let me use his account to receive the money wired from Taiwan when he knew I lost my ATM card.</p><p>Thanks for the extremely efficient Mr. Bai and Misasa, I finally have cash again. </p><p>The only thing I needed to decide at this moment was if I should convert this US currency to RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050963_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the mean time, Misasa got another pair of 720 Armour T337 sun glasses from the owner, Dino, of the RST shop. </p><p>She also got me a pair of regular glasses, and sent them both via DHL. </p><p>Now I don't have to worry about getting sun burn of my eyes anymore.</p><p>The old and new pair of sun glasses are basically the same model, only the color of the frames are different. </p><p>The old pair has a black frame, and this one has a silver frame.</p><p>Because of the tragic experience, I had added some elastic strap to secure my new glasses on my ears, </p><p>and a neck strap to prevent the glasses run away from me again.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050964_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So far, I got a pair of replacement sunglasses, retrieved my credit card from the bank, and received the cash wired from Taiwan.</p><p>One by one, many thanks to Misasa in Taiwan and Mr. Bai at Xinjiang, all my problems were solved, </p><p>otherwise, I was really not sure how was I going to continue my trip like this.</p><p> </p><p>But now, I am good again, I even bought some ice cream to celebrate at the hotel.</p><p>I spent the afternoon to organize the stuff I wanted to mail back to Taiwan.</p><p>Because the tires on Dido were still in a good condition, there was no need to retire them at Urumqi </p><p>(maybe I will check again when I arrive at the Kazakjstan border?). </p><p>So I ended up with 6 spare tires: I had 2 and Misasa just sent me 4. </p><p>In order to fit them all in my packs, I decided to send stuff like China map, entrance tickets, some souvenirs, back to Taiwan. </p><p> </p><p>It was very hopeful that I could finally leave here to continue my ride. </p><p>My original plan was to stay at Urumqi for 3 days, and now was the day 5 already. I almost felt like a residence here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050971_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I walked to the northwest side of Urumqi city and back to the hotel yesterday, and it was quite a long walk, </p><p>which actually boosted my confidence about my physical condition. </p><p>Today, I decided to challenge myself again, to walk to the northeast part of the city. </p><p>I should see the Shuimogou Park, some nature spring, six mountains and a river. </p><p>It should be a big park. I walked for one and a half hour, passed several traditional markets. </p><p>I was always very attracted by the fruits and veggie stands, with the price of 1-2 RMB per jing (1 Jing is about 1.1 pound), </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050979_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I can save a lot of money if I cook the food myself. </p><p>BUT, it was too much trouble to do so. </p><p>I ended up buying the pancakes (the kind with multi-layers) and finishing them on the way to Shuimogou Park.</p><p>It only cost 1 RMB to come here by bus. But I felt kind of laying back after staying here for so many days. </p><p>I thought this was an excellent workout opportunity for me, and I could always take bus back if I was really tired later on.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050977_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>By 8:30, I finally saw the big sign ”Shuimogou Park”, right in front of me. </p><p>My legs were so tired that I can only keep going by imagining how magnificent the nature spring and watermills would be once I found them.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050983_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I walked and walked and I could not find the park. </p><p>How could such a big park just disappear on earth?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050986_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Judging by these constructions, I was afraid that I got the worst timing to visit here. </p><p>I walked around the construction site and tried to find any trace of the PARK.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050988_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050991_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>With so many trees here, maybe it should be renamed as some forest/woods.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050993_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Following a small path, I saw the boarder of Urumqi city, some mountains, and some huge buildings look like power plants.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1050998_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060017_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>No matter how hard I tried, all I could see were trees and mountains, no spring, no watermills.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060019_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally I saw a lady who was doing her walks, </p><p>and she told me that I needed to continue for another 4 km to see the nature spring and watermills.</p><p>Oh My God!!! I can not walk any further, I was too tired. </p><p>I was afraid if I forced myself to walk another 4 km, I would not be able to ride my bike tomorrow.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060022_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I walked back down to the entrance, and found the bus station.</p><p>I took No.3 bus to get back to the hotel. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060024_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060025_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After spraying rest of the "Zero" (similar to Icy Hot or Bangay that can relieve muscle pain) on my legs, </p><p>I threw away the empty bottle. One less burden for Dido!</p><p>As for tonight, I was sure I would be so busy rearranging my packs, to get ready for tomorrow’s journey.</p></div>
