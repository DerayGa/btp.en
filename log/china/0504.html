Just finished the five red bean buns on the way not long ago, </p><p>when the fry pork chop noodle was served, I ate it up.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010241_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Some places had map boards, however, the maps were badly drawn, and nobody could read them</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010269_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>My newly developed fun is looking for roadside fruit stands selling pineapples at small villages.</p><p>In addition to fruit stands, I also looked forward to roadside kiosks.</p><p> </p><p>China was so overpopulated; it seemed that human replaced machines.</p><p>The roadside kiosks were operated by old women, nothing fancy about them but a beach umbrella and a white refrigerator.</p><p>The roadside kiosks carried beverages and cigarettes.</p><p>I did not buy from them except I was out of water or exhausted, because the beverages were overpriced.</p><p>Since I found out the kiosks carried ice pops; I always stopped by and ask for white sugar ice pops.</p><p>If they had them in stock, I would buy one, holding it in my mouth and enjoying the cold sensation.</p><p> </p><p>A method how not to get lost was developed along the way; therefore, it was not necessarily to read maps or road signs.</p><p>Following commuter bus as simple as it gets.</p><p>Fully loaded commuter buses ran between cities. When they passed by, I always carefully read the bus route on the windshield.</p><p>If the bus headed toward my destination, I was surely on the right track, kept going!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010267_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I was struggling up a uphill in the hot afternoon sun, </p><p>I spotted an old man at his sixty pulling a heavy loaded two-wheel cart. The cart was filled up with bottles for recycle.</p><p>An old woman behind the cart was pushing it to help the pulling.</p><p>They paired up to move the cart up to the steep slope just like me.</p><p>All of sudden, I was grateful for what I had got and who I were, no more complain! </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010270_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I felt like to stop and help them out; however, it was just a thought.</p><p>I had to fulfill my goal, B2P/Bike to protect our Planet</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010260_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Route 310 ran from HeNan province to ShaanXi province, I saw no province border sign along the way, but biked mindlessly. </p><p>Shouldn’t I have entered ShaanXi province?</p><p> </p><p>Rode into a bustling town after a hilltop</p><p>Ma’ma, where am I? HeNan or ShaanXi” I asked</p><p><br />I was not aware that I had arrived ShaanXi and done for the day! </p><p>Happily found a cheap hostel, 10 dollars RMB for one night, the room was even better than the 20 dollar room I had yesterday.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010283_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Washed clothes before sunset, I had to wear the same clothes tomorrow</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010280_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dinner was at “Xhue Family Original” run by a three generation family, </p><p>the family got the same last name as mine, Xhue. I felt good to support the restaurant.</p><p>My dinner included noodle, spicy bean sprout salad, and “BaoMo”. </p><p>It seemed nice to have salad on the hot summer night, wow! the salad was a bit spicy</p><p>BaoMo was baked bun stuffed with braised meat.</p><p><br />I got into this bustling city just by crossing a hill, who would knew what was waiting for me next?</p><p><br /></p>
