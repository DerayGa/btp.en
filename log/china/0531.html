By the time I left the hotel, </p><p>the street cleaners had already done sweeping the street, and were waiting for the garbage to burn out. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030900_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Hard-working miners also started their day —or they took shifts so the work can get done 24 hours non-stop?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030902_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>With no luck finding any restaurant/stall for breakfast, I decided to move on to Rt 312, and head for Xingxing Xia. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030905_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I made my own breakfast-on-the-"bike": crackers, milk, and raisins.</p><p>Since this was a pretty remote area, I "ordered" the same lunch as well. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030907_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And I told myself, "Look around! You are lucky to even have food". </p><p> </p><p>The weather in the morning was pretty breezy and comfortable. </p><p>I'd better ride faster for now. Once the wind started to blow crazy in the afternoon, I would have a hard time just to "move". </p><p> </p><p>From Gansu to Xinjiang was all alternating uphill and downhill ride, not much of elevation, </p><p>but I did cut through several mountains. </p><p>The deeper I biked into the remote area, the more I was proud of myself carrying more-than-enough of food </p><p>and drinks on my Dido. I can almost open a mobile grocery stand with these foods.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030922_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I noticed that I was on 3333 (I called it four 3s) mile mark on Rt 312, </p><p>I couldn't remember when was the last time I hit "four 2s", but I know I still have a long way to go on this journey.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030945_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was about 5 hours on the bike, and I had passed so many mountains. </p><p>The desert also changed its color, from light brown, to white, and now was red. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030951_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040001_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I felt pretty lack of energy at this moment, I wondered if that's because I didn't take enough break so far. </p><p>How much longer can I finally arrive at Xingjinag?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030935_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>He was the first Urumqi native I met. He had been traveling from Urumqi to Lhasa, and now on the way back home. </p><p>He asked me," Are you going home, too?" My home is thousands of kilometers away. </p><p>I am traveling "away" from home.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030928_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just when I was about to doze off, ON THE BIKE, I saw a little "store", covered by some black sheet. </p><p>I went close to check it up and found it sells watermelon.</p><p>Why did they sell watermelons at a place like this? Their major customers are the truck drivers, I came here was purely by chance.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030960_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>These watermelons were harvested from the owner's farm at Xian, and transported here to sell during the summer time.</p><p>Here is the truck. The front side is the store; behind it is where they sleep at night.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030967_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I asked the lady to pick a proper size of watermelon for me; I wanted to finish it before I moved on. </p><p>I can eat about half a jin (1 Jin is roughly 1.1 pound, or 0.5 kg) of dumplings at once, </p><p>but watermelon? Of course I can't stuff myself with 10 jins of it, can I?</p><p>Well, it was still early. I can eat this as my lunch, I would take my time, and I was sure that eventually, I would finish it.</p><p> </p><p>Every customer came here for watermelons will ask what were those dark brown-ish stuffs lying there? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030970-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ha, I asked the same question already, so I was so qualified to answer this.</p><p>"That is called Suoyang (Songaria Cynomorium Herb), also known as desert ginseng. </p><p>It is good for men—if you know what I mean. You usually soak it into wine and drink it."</p><p> </p><p>The mother and the daughter were in charge of selling watermelons at this store, </p><p>while rest of the family members stayed at Xian, to take care of Lanzhou honeydew melons and cottons.</p><p>If you ask me what's special about the melons here? I would say, hmm, too many seeds, too many big seeds. </p><p>But even so, it was quite sweet, not bad at all.</p><p>While I was enjoying my watermelon, the lady next door (next store) came to fill up her water and asked me about my trip. </p><p>To me, what I really wanted to ask was what they ate for the whole summer. Please don't tell me ONLY watermelons…</p><p> </p><p>On this photo, from right to left: the daughter, the mom, and the lady next store.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030972_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After finishing half o the watermelon, I had to get up to walk it off---evaporate the water out of my body, </p><p>literally, then I came back to finish up the rest of the melon.</p><p>It was so hot out there. I had to hide under the shade that this store provided; </p><p>I ate my watermelon here, and rested a bit afterwards, too.</p><p>I looked into my backpacks, and I decided to share my oranges.</p><p>I gave them one each, but they were concerned that I might get hungry later, so they three shared only one.</p><p> </p><p>I really had a great time chatting with them. The mother wanted to give me a watermelon, but I really can't carry this huge melon with me. </p><p>So, she gave me this pancake that was bigger than my face.</p><p>It was pretty dry to begin with, and this one was even "drier" because it was "sun-dried". It felt pretty rough on the surface.</p><p>After taking some bites, I knew I had found my brick flatbread a best friend. </p><p>They were definitely made for each other, and they both can break your teeth.I</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030974-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>wanted to pay the mother some cash for this cake, but I knew she won't accept it. </p><p>She wanted to make sure I have enough food on the road.</p><p>I guess that was because what I said earlier that after biking more than 100 km without seeing any civilization, </p><p>I told myself that I will always have enough food in my backpacks. </p><p>Well, I can't pay her money. So I shared the egg rolls as my token of appreciation, and they finally accepted it.</p><p> </p><p>We talked and talked, until almost 2:00 in the afternoon. And I was only 20 km away from my destination, so I was in no rush at all.</p><p>However, the wind started to get stronger, even this little store was going to fly up to the sky. </p><p>It agreed again with what others told me about the strong wind in the afternoon.</p><p>Well, I thought this is the hint for me to move on, so I packed that brick flatbread into my backpacks, </p><p>but left the egg rolls on the table, "gift exchange".</p><p> </p><p>As I continued my journey, I noticed something interesting. </p><p>It was exactly the same road. In the morning, I had a great time enjoying the biking. </p><p>In the afternoon, the strong upwind totally changed the scenario: it was so difficult to keep moving forward.</p><p>So I tried to see it as a warm-up for later challenges that I will encounter, and I knew there would be MANY.</p><p> </p><p>I can't help but taking some photos here. This "red" desert is really beautiful when you look at it from a distance. </p><p>Feels like the whole desert is on fire, feels like I am brought back to ancient China.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1030996_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was riding uphill after leaving the watermelon store, and the very top would be the Xingxing Xia. </p><p>I had to work really hard on the paddle.</p><p>All I had in mind was TOMORROW. It is around 200 km between Xingxing Xia and Hami, </p><p>the chances to meet anybody in-between will be very slim, the only stop in-between will be a camel stop, </p><p>the only scene I will see is Gobi desert.</p><p>Therefore, I have only two options: camping, or ride the whole 200 km in one day.</p><p> </p><p>I saw a guy wearing a straw hat and sitting by his luggage in the middle of nowhere. My first thought was, he was a homeless.</p><p>But, he was studying the map, a CHINESE map. I guessed he was also a traveler, </p><p>maybe by hitch-hiking? Well, look at how carefree he was, I grinned.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040002_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was about 2 km away from Xingxing Xia, the new sign has Chinese and another interesting language, </p><p>which looked like two flowers blooming in the desert.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040004_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This was the first time I saw a sign pointing Urumqi, which is a couple of thousands away from Beijing.</p><p>After biking for over a month, finally I was only 700 km away from the capital of Xinjiang, </p><p>Urumqi, which might take me from 7-10 days to arrive. </p><p>The arrival of Urumqi also means the journey in China territory will end soon.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040005_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally, I entered Xingxing Xia at around 4:00 in the afternoon. </p><p>The place with such a pretty name—Xingxing means stars in Chinese, turned out was not that pretty after all.</p><p>Since there was no rest area around 100 km before or after, </p><p>this place was full of trucks parking there while the drivers take a break and have lunch.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040020_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Lots of restaurants, truck repair shops, grocery stores, and three gas stations. Not really for tourists.</p><p> </p><p>I decided to stay here for one night, 10 RMB, because of its name, Xingxing Xia.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040006_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was a nice room, decent size, and came with coal and furnace. You can put the coals into the furnace if necessary.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040010_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There was no tap water, though. So I had to fetch a pail of water and used that to clean up myself. Suddenly I felt so much better.</p><p> </p><p>I had my dinner at the restaurant next door, I ordered a lamb soup, stir-fried bok choi with pork, and steamed twisted rolls.</p><p>The TV in the restaurant couldn't play regular programs due to lack of signals, </p><p>so they played karaoke VCD instead. Listening to these weird songs, I finally had my first REAL meal on the table for today. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040013_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The backyard of this hotel was very spacious and not much light to affect the star-watching. </p><p>Since this place is called Xingxing Xia, there was no way I would miss the opportunity to view the stars at night.</p><p>I went to bed very early at night, got up at 3:00 and took some photos of the sky that was filled with stars, totally overwhelming to me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040025_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Luckily, I caught some shooting stars and the big dipper on my photos. </p><p>Shiveringly, I stood under the starry sky, and enjoyed the peaceful and yet noisy atmosphere at this special night.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1040026_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><br /></p>
