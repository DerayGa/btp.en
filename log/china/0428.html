										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-7_med_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Late at night, heavy knocking on the door, “Brother, are you asleep yet? Can you open the door….,” </span></p><p>After several knockings on the door, the door opened. </p><p>I woke up and thought this must be a robbery. Looked up and realized it was Mr. Big Beard (the hotel owner). </p><p>Come to find out there were more people checked in and not enough blankets, so he needed to get more blankets from my room.</p><p> </p><p>Looked at the watch and it was 11:40 pm. People just checking in now? </p><p>That is too pitiful. I hope I will never be in that situation looking a place to stay in the middle of night. </p><p>I then fell right back to sleep in a few seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Normally the checkout time at hotels is12:00 pm or maybe 11:00 am, I thought. At 6:00 early in the morning, </p><p>as I was putting all the bags back on Dido and tying my headscarf, Mr. Big Beard walked in again. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you leaving now, brother?”</p><p>Yeeeessss…. I will leave in about 5 minutes…. Why?</p><p>“Oh, nothing, someone is checking in and this room is the only room I have left”</p><p>Took a peak outside, there were a man and a woman waiting outside. </p><p>What is going on here? People either checking in in the middle of night or early in the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily I get up very early these days, otherwise, </p><p>I don’t think I will feel too good to be woken up early in the morning and to be kicked out of the room.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000785_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Took the bike over to Mr. Big Beard’s grocery store and asked him to fill up the water bottles for me.</p><p> </p><p>I then bought 2 bags of milk for breakfast, one RMB for each bag. </p><p>Although the plastic packaging looks kind of strange, but it is very convenient to tear off one corner with my teeth and then drink from it. </p><p>The taste is not too bad, either.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000786_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I left Handan , a mixture of modern and ancient city, in the morning. </p><p>This is the last city I stayed in Hebei Province. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000787_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Actually by looking at the car license plate, you would know which region you are in. </p><p>When I was in Beijing, all the license plates have Jingon them.</p><p>After leaving urban area of Beijing, they became Ji , which is the abbreviation of Hebei Province. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000790_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Continued riding toward south approximately 50 km is the boarder between Henan and Hebei. </p><p>There is no special sign here; just a gate indicates you are entering Henan.</p><p> </p><p>Once entering Henan, most of license plates now have Yu on them, the abbreviation of Henan Province. </p><p>Not only the license plates are different, so does the dialect. </p><p>My imitated Beijing dialect is no longer useful because people here don’t use Beijing dialect, instead now is Henan dialect.</p><p> </p><p>Also I can’t say I am from Beijing anymore. </p><p>Before Beijing wasn’t that far from Hebei Province and telling people that I am from Beijing didn’t draw that much attention. </p><p>But now, if I said I am from Beijing, there will be a big announcement,</p><p>“Come here! Hurry! This guy rode his bike from Beijing!” </p><p>Then there is a series of questions. How far have you ridden the bike? </p><p>For how many days? </p><p>What do you do? </p><p>Where are you going? </p><p>Where are you from? </p><p>None stop questions.</p><p> </p><p>So now when I answer these questions, just like getting caught by the ticket checkers on the trains, </p><p>when they asked which stop did you get on, the standard answer is always from the previous stop. </p><p>”I am from Handan.”</p><p>But it doesn’t quite work here, either. </p><p>This is because Handan is in Hebei and I am in Henan now, so it still feels very far away. </p><p>But at least it doesn’t draw as much attention compare with before.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000804_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>At noon, I had lunch in Anyang . Lunch was sweet bean sauce noodle and stir fry bean sprouts. </p><p>If this is the real sweet bean sauce noodle, </p><p>I don’t know what kind of sweet bean sauce noodle I have been eaten my whole life. </p><p>It didn’t come with black-colored sauce, instead it has a mixture of scramble eggs, bean curd, </p><p>tempura and lots of vegetable in broth to spread on top of noodle. </p><p>It was super delicious. I didn’t want to just have a simple lunch, so I ordered stir fry bean sprouts. </p><p> </p><p>When the dish came out, it was only bean sprouts, cooked with hot pepper and some sort of unknown ingredient that tasted sour. </p><p>Although it was very good, but when I ordered bean sprouts and it came with bean sprouts only, </p><p>I didn’t know why I felt something was missing? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000798_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Was it because the whole Jah Jah Men only cost 3.50 RMB and a bean sprouts dish cost 4 RMB, so I expected more from it?</p><p> </p><p>The restaurant owner asked me if I wanted beer? I said do you have cola?</p><p>Yes, but it’s no cold. I asked her to put a bottle of cola in the refrigerator so it would be cold when finishing lunch and some rest.</p><p> </p><p>After lunch, I took a nap until 12:30 pm and then continued riding toward south.</p><p>Today, the wind was blowing against me the whole day, so the riding speed was very slow. </p><p>The speedometer fluctuated between 10 – 13 km/h. </p><p> </p><p>I was riding in a slow pace, so I just followed a street vendor who rode a bike that carried many small items.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000807_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I was slowly riding the bike for whole day. </p><p>Nothing interesting or strange things happened so I started daydreaming again.</p><p> </p><p>A hundred years ago, in 1907, the motor challenge from Beijing to Paris announced the upcoming automobile era. </p><p>Today, a hundred years later, I am asking myself, what kind of future are we leaving behind for our children? </p><p> </p><p>A hundred years from now after we are gone, in 2107, </p><p>when people look back, what kind of reviews are they going to give us.</p><p> </p><p>It has been thousand of years since human race have history. </p><p>During this time, a lot of things have happened. </p><p>Mankind has created a lot of wonderful music, arts and cuisines.</p><p>Of course we also have done a lot of idiotic things, such as wars and invading to other countries.</p><p> </p><p>But looking back at the thousand years of history, which era do we really hate? </p><p>Even World War II, there are still a lot of stories people relish about.</p><p>Not to mention the fascinating stories from the era of exploration of sea, Three Kingdoms and Warring States Periods .</p><p> </p><p>The only exception is “Today”.</p><p>“Today” is an ironic era. It is the first time human race promotes environment protection. </p><p>At the same time, it is the era that has destroyed our environment the most.</p><p> </p><p>What are we leaving behind for our future generations a hundred years later?</p><p>Is it going to be the era where they can only see polar bear in specimens at the museums?</p><p>Is it going to be the era where they can only see Arctic through the documentary films?</p><p>Is it going to be the era with abnormal climate changes, many biological extinctions and sadness only?</p><p> </p><p>In the science fiction movies, whenever they mentioned about the future, the majority of films have cars flew in the sky.</p><p>Why are the cars flying in the sky?</p><p>It must be because the roads can’t handle the traffic volume so in order to accommodate that many cars, cars have to fly.</p><p>But do we really need that many cars?</p><p><br />Frankly, cars are supposed to be a transportation tool. </p><p>If public transit is good, who wants to spend time to learn how to drive, </p><p>spend significant savings to buy cars, buy more and more expensive gas, </p><p>wasting time looking for parking space, paying one ticket after another one and endless maintenance on the cars? </p><p> </p><p>A hundred year later, when people looking back at us, </p><p>will they give us“hatred” review because our era is the most destructive era ever in the human history.</p><p> </p><p>If we don’t do anything right now to change all this, </p><p>we will have to spend a hundred times or even a thousand times more efforts to change this.</p><p>When polar bears become distinct, how much effort will it take to reproduce one?</p><p>If people ask me what will I go after finishing this bike tour?</p><p>I will probably say to Arctic and apologize to polar bears. </p><p>Because of me not doing anything causing them become distinct.</p><p>It’s not because what I have done that is killing them, </p><p>but because I have the opportunity to do something and I feel it’s not of my business.</p><p><br />Able to do something, but not doing anything causing harms to them.</p><p>Bystanders are guilty, too, isn’t it?</p><p> </p><p>Guilty for what?</p><p> </p><p>A hundred years later when they judge our era. </p><p>If they say the Earth becomes the way it is because of these people. </p><p>These people should be hated, condemned and even cursed. </p><p>Then I think we are all need to share this responsibility.</p><p>I remembered when I was in the military service. At the beginning of training, </p><p>I was a rookie. I saw several squad leaders were disassembling over a hundred guns before delivering to them other units. </p><p>While these squad leaders were chatting and disassembling the guns, a commander walked in and said </p><p>“You idiots, how long is this going to take? Why don’t you gather the soldiers to help? </p><p>One soldier per gun and this will be taking care of in 3 minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Those squad leaders were actually doing something and why did they get yelled at? </p><p>Was it because the method they did it with was incorrect or they had wrong attitude or wrong approach?</p><p> </p><p>Some might said </p><p>“Deray, you stupid idiot. Do you think you can stop global warming by riding the bike by yourself? </p><p>It will be more effective if I keep my refrigerator door opened!”</p><p> </p><p>The CEO of General Motor or Ford might say, </p><p>“Hey, what is this Taiwanese guy doing? Who does he think he is? Does he think he can influence automobile industry?”</p><p> </p><p>Of course, one person is definitely not enough and I never though that I can save the Earth by myself. </p><p>But if by participating this campaign can influence more people want to ride bikes. </p><p>Let Taiwan become a better environment for bicyclists. </p><p>Let the whole world know that Taiwan is not a “Greed Island”, but a “Green Island”.</p><p> </p><p>Let the future generations have an opportunity to see a live polar bear.</p><p>Let the children can have a dream to become an Arctic explorer, not an Arctic archaeologist.</p><p> </p><p>Time flies when your mind is wondering all over the places. </p><p>Now its’ 4:00 pm and I have just arrived in a city.</p><p>I looked up the sign, it is a place called Hebi and I couldn’t find it on the map.</p><p><br />My knees were getting sore. </p><p>Even though time flies when you are daydreaming, but that doesn’t make the distance short and riding easier.</p><p>I saw a big sign said “Lodging”, so I walked over there with my bike and checked the price. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000809_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The response is no longer in the familiar Beijing dialect, but the thick Henan dialect. </p><p>Wait until I master this dialect and then I can pretend I am from Henan.</p><p> </p><p>The lady from the counter asked me where I came from. </p><p>I said I started from Handan. She asked how far was it? </p><p>Looked at the speedometer, it indicated 110 km. </p><p>Told her exactly that and she was very happy and asked me if I was tired? Need to rest? </p><p>And then show me the room.</p><p>This is a European-class hotel. Clean single bed, specious room, a color TV with cable, even a sofa, </p><p>a console table and AC and heating unit. </p><p>Not to mention the chamber-pot sitting in the corner.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000811_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is best room I have stayed in so far and I was worried if it’s too expensive. </p><p>The old lady said that since I was such a brave soul riding bike all the way from Handan to here, </p><p>she can charge me only 20 RMB. Convert to NT that is less than 100 NT. </p><p>And there is a free public shower room! </p><p>I dropped everything and picked up my dirty clothes along with towel and soap and rushed to the shower room. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000815_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Wow! It is a real shower room! </p><p>Wow! There is running hot water!</p><p>Wow! It is a real shower room! </p><p>(I know I said this already, but I am just too excited.)</p><p> </p><p>It has been a week since the beginning of the trip and this is the first time I could take a real and comfortable shower.</p><p>Washed and rinsed the windbreaker. This piece of clothing will be the indicator of how dirty I am. </p><p>Hopefully when I arrive in Paris, I can still tell this original color of this cloth is blue and grey.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner is been taking care of at the restaurant right next to the hotel. </p><p>It is a decent restaurant, even the wait staff are wearing uniforms. </p><p>Looked at the menu, prices were ranging between 10 to 20 RMB, some are even 30 RMB. </p><p>Pricing is not the absolute, but relative. </p><p>Although the most expensive dish here is about the same price as the stir fry at the street vendor in Taiwan. </p><p>But after experienced the living standard here, </p><p>suddenly seeing a dish that costs almost one day’s allowance, I still feel it was too expensive. </p><p> </p><p>I ordered a bowl of braised noodle and got a bowl of noodle soup. </p><p>Not only it has the regular noodle in there, it also had rice noodle and bean curd. </p><p>The soup is made of pork stock. This big bowl of soup was very filling and only cost 4 RMB. </p><p><br />At night, I watched some TV, read a book and had a good night sleep.</p><p>The old lady asked me for and ID, I told her that I left it at home and can I just write my information down? </p><p>And no problem. </p><p>I wondered if I show her my Taiwanese ID, how much is going to cost me for this comfortable room?</p><p><br /></p>
