										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-18_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">I went to bed later than normal last night. </span></p><p>I was up late reading “One Hundred Years of Solitude” and couldn’t put it down. </p><p>So this morning I had hard time getting up. By the time I departed it was 7 o’clock already.</p><p>Baoji city is in a rectangular shape. So I will ride from east to west to across the whole city today.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010617_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>About 8 o’clock, just as I was leaving Baoji, I heard a very familiar music broadcasted from a loudspeaker.</p><p>“Stretching exercises, 1, 2, 3, 4 … “ Isn’t that the national exercise routines that we had to do in the elementary school?</p><p>Even the music and commands were exactly the same! I stopped and watched the students doing the same exercise </p><p>routines as I did when I was in school. Oh, the good old days.</p><p>I turned around and looked up. When I saw the school name, it made me laugh so hard. </p><p>The name of this school is “Shaanxi Province Baoji Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory Children School” :-)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010622_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While I was looking for the road to Tianshui, I accidentally climbed up a hill.</p><p>But that is ok because I will have to climb many hills today and one more hill is not going to hurt.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010627_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The roads from Baoji to Tianshui were between valleys so there were less climbing up and down the mountains. </p><p>But occasionally I still had to climb up and down the mountains. </p><p><br />Today is the first time that I have to go through a tunnel. </p><p>I was worry that my GPS wouldn’t be able to receive signals while I was in the tunnel and it would mess up the track.</p><p>I stopped after passed through a tunnel and checked the GPS. </p><p>There was only a small section of track was messed up. Overall, it was pretty precise. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010632_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The tunnels here were pretty scary. They were all 1 – 2 km long. Some were a little bit longer. </p><p>But none of them had lights or they only had very dim yellow lights. </p><p>For cars, it might not matter because cars have head lights. </p><p>But for cyclists, this is the worst nightmare. </p><p>First of all, I was afraid that I might get tripped over because it was so dark inside the tunnel. </p><p>Second, I was afraid that I might get run over from cars behind me. </p><p><br />Before entering the tunnel, I took of the sun hat and changed my sunglasses to the regular glasses;otherwise I would be blind as a bat.</p><p>Then I changed the red taillight to blinking mode and turned on Dido’s headlight.</p><p>Luckily Dido has a petal powered generated lights. </p><p>I only have to turn on the switch and while I am riding the bike, it will generate enough electricity to keep the headlight on.</p><p>This way I don’t have to worry about running out of batteries and the halogen lamp was bright enough for me to see.</p><p>Good thing there weren’t that many cars here (there were more trucks though). </p><p>Traffic was pretty light, so it wasn’t that difficult to pass through the tunnels safely. </p><p>Throughout the day, I probability passed 6 or 7 tunnels.</p><p> </p><p>Here is another first time. Right after I passed the first tunnel, I got my first flat tire. </p><p>Because of the construction, either the road condition was very bad or there was only a small path. </p><p>From the surface it shouldn’t be any problem. But you get a flat tire as soon as you get on the road.</p><p>It broke my heart when I saw the front wheel had a flat tire. I moved the bike to the side of the 15th branch.</p><p>I was looking for a shady spot to change the inner tube.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010640_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Unload the 3 bags at the front, disassemble the front wheel, took out tools and spare inner tube, now I am ready to change tire.</p><p>It has been a long time since I had to change the inner tube. </p><p>After the bike tour in France, I haven’t had any opportunity to change tire myself. </p><p>I almost forgot how to do this if it wasn’t for this time.</p><p>There were broken glasses that had poked through the outer tube and into the inner tube. </p><p>You can’t tell really from the surface. There were just very small holes. </p><p>In order to take out the broken glasses, I had to pried open the outer tube, </p><p>and then used a small tweezer to pull out the broken glasses one at a time.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010641_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While I was changing the inner tube, people from the 15th branch came over and watched me getting flustered.</p><p>The 15th branch is the unit that is in charge of the construction here. </p><p>I told them that I had a flat tire while I was riding on the path in front of us. </p><p>“The road condition is very bad and please fix them.”</p><p>The highway they are working on right now is called Bao Tian Highway, which is from Baoji to Tianshui.</p><p>The construction will finish next year, in the mean time, this impacts a lot of national freeways and the road condition becomes very bad.</p><p>I took me about half hour to fix the flat tire while chitchatting with the workers from the 15th branch. </p><p>Before I left, I asked them to fill my water bottles.</p><p> </p><p>Today again is a bright sunny day. I have been wearing the sun hat since this morning. </p><p>I drank a lot of water and got all sweaty. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010665_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Riding along the valleys, obviously there were less roadside shops and fewer towns. </p><p>There were only a few restaurants and body shops open along the roadway. </p><p>Lunch time, I stopped at a small restaurant and order half kilogram of dumplings. This time, there were 30 dumplings :-)</p><p>During lunch time, I found out that the owner is one of the construction workers. </p><p>This is a very difficult construction. In order to build highway as straight as possible,</p><p>they have to build bridges to cross rivers and tunnels through mountains. </p><p>I don’t know when they will be able to finish the construction.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010661_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While I was eating dumplings, there was a loud sound, “BOOM!”</p><p>It scared me to death, but the owner seemed like didn’t even hear that. I asked him what was that?</p><p>Come to find out, they were blowing up the mountain to build tunnels.</p><p> </p><p>What? I had to ride along the construction site and they were using the explosives. Is it dangerous?</p><p>Oh, don’t worry about it,” the owner said casually while smoking. </p><p>But the sound of explosion was still lingering in the valley.</p><p> </p><p>Not long after the lunch time, I have passed through the border between Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. </p><p>Just a plain road sign indicated I have finished another province.</p><p>The distance to Tianshui is about 180 kilometers. </p><p>I didn’t want to make it too aggressive so I am going to make it a 2-day trip.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010663_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After arrive Gansu and rode a little bit more, I can start looking for a place to stay over night around 3 – 4 o’clock in the afternoon. </p><p>I want to get plenty of rest so I can continue to ride tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>3:30 in the afternoon, I decided to stay at a roadside hotel. </p><p>This hotel is owned by a couple and their son.</p><p>The name of this town is called “Dizhuang”. What a simple name. </p><p>I don’t think I will need to use the tent in China because there are lodging places everywhere.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010668_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was only 10 RMB a night here and there was a nice breeze at the front door.</p><p>I got a bucket of cold water from the well, had a sponge bath and then rinsed the outfit I was wearing earlier.</p><p>Took the clothes the roof, grandma gave me bamboo pole to line dry my clothes.</p><p>Today the sun is very bright with strong wind. My clothes were dried in an hour.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010675_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I ordered a bowl of braised noodle and I thought the grandma would be the one who cooked. </p><p>But ended up it was the son.</p><p>It was surprisingly delicious. There were green peppers, cabbages, bean curds, tomatoes and shredded pork with hand-made noodle.</p><p>The soup was spicy with a touch of sweet and sour, not greasy at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010670_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The owner’s son learned how to cook in Baoji. He had also a year of experience at a restaurant in Beijing.</p><p>That’s why his cooking was super delicious. I complimented him about his cooking. He was very humble and said, </p><p>“No, the taste is not quite there, yet.”</p><p> </p><p>I pulled a stood and sit at the front door just like them. The wind was blowing. </p><p>At this moment, it didn’t matter whether the wind was blowing with me or against me as long as it was a breeze.</p><p>I drank the cold beer that the owner had put in the refrigerator for me earlier while enjoyed the beautiful mountain view.</p><p>When I was riding, I had to pay attention for the road condition. </p><p>If I wanted to enjoy the view, I had to either stop the bike or fall off the bike.</p><p> </p><p>Here is the view from the back of the house. You can climb these mountains. It must be very beautiful up there.</p><p>The little house in the lower left hand corner is the bathroom. The smell was very strong.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010676_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After finished one bottle of beer, I asked the owner to put another one in the refrigerator. </p><p>Later, I will ask the son to cook something delicious to go with the beer (mouth watering)</p><p><br /></p>
