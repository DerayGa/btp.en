It looked sweet, more to my taste.</p><p>It tasted kind of like steamed sponge cake. I seem to be pretty good at choosing food </p><p>(or maybe it’s just because I’m not picky. =..=)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010880_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Following the road I came from, Lanzhou is only 110 km ahead. </p><p>If all goes well, I should be able to make it today, but that’s if all goes well…</p><p>Sure enough, this road disappeared not long after I left DingXi. There were two roads that diverged in a yellow wood. </p><p>I took the one less traveled by, only because there were bicycle tracks on the dirt road.</p><p>And that made all the difference. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010884_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After riding for about 10 km, as I was distracted; I heard someone say hello to me from the opposite lane in a very weird accent. </p><p>And that’s how I meat Natu, another bike traveler. </p><p>She was a Korean born in Japan, 28 years old.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010887_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Starting from Shanghai on March 19th, she took almost two months to get to where she is now, because she only rides 50 km a day. </p><p>When I first saw her, the first thought that passed my mind was ~ </p><p>How did she do it with such little luggage?</p><p>Then, what does that make me look like with all this stuff? @@”</p><p> </p><p>What made us the same was that we were both heading toward Lanzhou. </p><p>But, how could that be? </p><p>We’re on the same road, both going to Lanzhou, </p><p>then why is she coming from that way and I’m coming from this way? What is going on?</p><p> </p><p>One of us must be going the wrong way. After asking a guy riding by on a motorcycle, </p><p>we found out that it was I who was going the wrong way. Orz </p><p>The guy said that we should turn back and go on the highway.</p><p>But…But can we really ride on the highway? @@”</p><p>And I only ended up here because I didn’t choose the highway at the diverged roads.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe I should have took the road more traveled by after all. </p><p>Following the guy’s directions, we went to try our luck on the highway. But our luck ran out before even getting to the tollbooth. /_\</p><p>What on earth should we do now? We have already taken both roads, </p><p>there’s no other way to go; could turning back to DingXi be our only choice?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010889_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A traffic control fellow told us that there was this little path that we could take, </p><p>but it wouldn’t be easy. It was our only option, so we took it. </p><p>It was really a very small road, and because of going astray this morning, it was already high noon and I had only advanced 40 km.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/rimg1337_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had lunch at a little town, sweet bean sauce noodles with beer. </p><p>The sun was at its highest; I would have got sunstroke if I hadn’t had something cool.</p><p> </p><p>This was from Natu’s notebook, she is learning Mandarin and Chinese food as she travels:</p><p>“Eating is a way of learning” that’s what she said. =..=</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010893_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I thought the road was bad, it soon got worse. What we were riding on after lunch could barely be called a road. </p><p>It was just a dirt path going along the railway. ~_~</p><p>Would this really lead to Lanzhou? </p><p>I had my doubts, but we had no choice but to keep on going.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010901_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After following this path for a while, we came to the side gate of a train station. </p><p>OK, I guess we’re really lost now~ </p><p>Since there’s not much we could do about it, why not take a break at the train station. </p><p>The staff at the train station were very friendly, we had fresh water and got to get out of the sun. </p><p>This was a very small station, no trains seemed to stop here, but the staff still greeted every train as it went by.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010904_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After resting for half an hour, we moved on. </p><p>The staff at the train station said that we would have to climb a mountain called High Cliff Mountain. </p><p>Just the sound of it was scary enough, but actually it was even more outrageous then that.</p>

											</div><p><br /></p><p>There were many places we had to walk our bikes through. Some slopes were over 35 degrees. </p><p>There was no way we could ride up. To add to that it was a dirt road covered with gravel. </p><p>Holding our bikes we climbed up this 2000m mountain, but when we got to the top, the view was absolutely spectacular.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010920_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This was an exclusive view for crazy bikers, and I stood and sucked it all in. </p><p>It moved me deeply.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010918_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010922_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Riding down the mountain brought us to a town called High Cliff Town.</p><p>I was riding in front of Natu, so I looked back once in a while to see if she was still there. </p><p>But when I looked back when I got to the town, </p><p>I DIDN’T SEE HER.</p><p> </p><p>Worriedly, I rode back to see what might have happened.</p><p>It turned out that she had had a flat tire.</p><p>I thought that this shouldn’t be a big problem, because she has ridden around Japan two times before, </p><p>once in three months and once in one month.</p><p> </p><p>A flat tire should be a piece of cake for her.</p><p>After all she has ridden from Shanghai to Lanzhou, then from there she was going to ride another five months. </p><p>Going from Lanzhou to Lhasa, then to Nepal, after that India, then to Thailand, and from Thailand to Hong Kong.</p><p>THAT’S QUITE A WAY TO RIDE. </p><p>She's got to be kidding if she didn’t bring any inner tubes or repair tools for her bike.</p><p> </p><p>But that seemed to be the case.</p><p>SHE HAD BROUGHT NOTHING！！！！/_\</p><p>No wonder she had such little luggage. Trying to ride a journey like this without any supplements, that was really gambling with your life.</p><p>She already had two flat tires on this trip, fortunately both times happened in a city, and there are bike shops all over the place in China.</p><p>So she thought that there would be no problem finding someplace to fix her bike, and it was cheap too. She said an inner tube only cost 10 RMB.</p><p>But what I was worried about wasn’t the question of finding a shop or if it was cheap or not. </p><p>Rather, what if the bike broke down in the middle of nowhere; what could she do then?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010897_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Anyway, we walked her bike to a bike shop. The owner knew how to change it,</p><p>but he didn’t have the material (size 26C inner tube). He would have it tomorrow, he said. </p><p>So I gave her one of mine for the time being, and helped the owner change it.</p><p>Using our own inner tube, it only cost 3 RMB.</p><p>We found out that what caused the flat tire was not because something punctured it, </p><p>but because the lining inside of the frame was all worn out, and the inner tube was rubbing against the screws on the frame of the tire.</p><p>At a shop that doesn’t even have an inner tube, I guess asking if they could replace the lining was out of the question. I was right.</p><p>So we taped up the ruined lining, hoping that it would hold for a while. </p><p>Knowing that this wouldn't hold forever, we had to find a bigger bike shop that could replace it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/rimg0522_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After this fix, it was already five o’clock, so we decided to call it a day at this Town of the High Cliff. </p><p>It was about 70 km from Lanzhou, so we should be able to get there by noon tomorrow.</p><p>There was only one very small hotel in town. With a record breaking price of 5 RMB a night,</p><p>up until now this was the cheapest hotel on this journey.</p><p> </p><p>There was this little kid in the hotel, </p><p>He was four years old and had a red face like all the other kids around, taken care by his grandma. </p><p>They called him “Daka” (at least that’s what it sounded like ~_~).</p><p>He really enjoyed playing with Natu.</p><p>I don’t really know how to play with children so I gave him some candy that I bought two weeks before; </p><p>somehow was still there Then I lent him my sun cap.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010930_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Gansu is really a very dry place; there were no faucets in the hotel. All there were was a water vat to wash your face ：D </p><p>And, after you washed your face you shouldn’t just pour the water on the floor. </p><p>What you should do is to put the water into a bigger vat so that they could use it for irrigation.</p><p>I learned this the hard way, because when I poured the water on the floor, </p><p>the old lady at the hotel said to me in an anguished way that I shouldn’t have done that.</p><p>I’m sure every drop of water is precious here, because all the farms are covered with a transparent plastic cloth to prevent dehydration.</p><p> </p><p>Natu was really a beer lover; she could ride with no supplements, but she would never forget to bring her bottle opener. XD </p><p>For dinner at this small town we had kung bao pork, beef noodles and vegetables.</p><p> </p><p>Thanks to Natu, it was easier for me to take pictures today.</p><p>Actually it took me a long time to think about if I should put Natu in my travel notes.</p><p>Because many of you might think “Wow, an encounter with a beautiful woman”.</p><p><br />I had thought that maybe if I didn’t write about it that would save me some trouble, </p><p>but then I thought “nothing really happened, it was just two people meeting on the way. Why should I care what other people think.”</p><p><br />After Lanzhou, one was heading toward Sinkiang, and the other toward Tibet. </p><p>But we were both dreamers carrying out our dreams.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/rimg0295_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="675" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Photographed by: Natu.
