										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-16_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Nothing particular planned for today, I started my own self-guided cycling tour </span></p><p>with buying a map at a newsstand in front of the train station,so I won’t get lost.</p><p>There were many street hawkers selling maps. </p><p>The maps for the traditional downtown, the area encircled by the city wall probably only one-fifteenth of the whole Xian city, </p><p>were small and about 2 or 3 RMB. The larger maps with the size of a poster were 4 RMB.</p><p> </p><p>As for the breakfast, I had my own water and bought a basket of eight meat buns that should be enough for the whole morning.</p><p>The City Wall of Xian which had been repaired a few times through out the time is the most complete city wall that has survived in China. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010557_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Not only is the wall well-maintained, but the moat surrounding it is preserved. </p><p>The land outside of the wall which was fields a few decades ago has been expanded and becomes a bustling and busy metropolis. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010506_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the morning, I first went to the Bell Tower, the geographical center of the traditional downtown. </p><p>I skipped tower climbing as one has to pay entrance fee to enter the tower. </p><p>Moreover, I had seen it and did not care whether I climbed it or not</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010481_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>My next stop was the Muslim Quarter (also known as Muslim Street) where the Muslim community lives and works today. </p><p>The area is comparable to the concentration of a Chinese shops and Chinese business in a Chinatown.</p><p>A Muslim is someone who follows the religion of Islam.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010508_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In Muslim Quarter, Muslim men wear white hats and Muslim women are veiled, </p><p>you can find various Muslim foods. Please keep this in mind; never mention pork and alcohol in Muslim Quater. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010496_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>To experience Muslim flavor, I tried a hot green onion pan cake (so-called “green onion box” by locals)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010511_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While eating the one-dollar-RMB super hot pan cake, I followed a group of Muslim along a narrow street lined with antique stores, </p><p>finding the Great Mosque which was located in an alley where it is hard to maneuver for both cars and bikers. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010520_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010521_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>One has to pay the entrance fee for the mosque. I knew nothing about the Islam, </p><p>even if I visited the mosque, I won’t understand the culture. Mosque visiting was skipped.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010527_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the heavy-shaded Muslim Quarter, the GPS signal was lost which resulted in tracking errors and random data, </p><p>finally the tracking data of the day was abandoned.</p><p><br />I bumped into a movie theater in the city where Spider Man III was playing. </p><p>Ticket prices were 35 RMB for adults and 25 RMB for students.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010479_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I would miss a lot of summer movies and movie sequels, such as Pirates of Caribbean, Harry Potter, and Shrek. </p><p>The movies should be available on DVD by the time I got back to Taiwan, </p><p>and I would finish out these great movies in one day like a couch potato.</p><p><br /></p><p>I had heard that DVD piracy was rampant in China. I was still shocked when I saw it with my own eyes.</p><p>The 6-dollar-RMB pirated Spider Man III DVD on display in store window attempted me. </p><p>The price was even cheaper than renting. I had the lady owner play the DVD for me. </p><p>The quality of the DVD was mediocre, but it was dubbed in Chinese, yikes! I did not buy the DVD, but kept treasure hunting in the store. </p><p> </p><p>Besides the new releases, all other DVDs were four RMB in MPEG-4 format burned into DVD-D9 disc. </p><p>What on earth was I talking about? </p><p> </p><p>Let me put it this way, these DVDs could have the entire movie collection of Yun-Fat Chow, or Stephen Chow, or the complete series of X-Files. </p><p>They resembled the “complete game book” sold in GuanHua Market in Taiwan years ago, the content changed from games to films or TV series.</p><p> </p><p>I really felt like to buy one as a souvenir, but it seemed stupid to carry a DVD for half a year, I did not pursue it.</p><p><br />The buildings inside the city wall are nice. The Xian Police Department has such a elaborate gateway.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010505_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After leaving the traditional downtown, I rode westbound to the starting point of the Silk Road, </p><p>my starting point for tomorrow morning as well. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010544_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The brown statue at the starting point, probably 50 meters long, was roughly carved out of a rock without details. </p><p>I propped Dido against the statue, starting tomorrow, Dido would follow Zhang Qian, </p><p>the imperial envoy of Han Dynasty, and the panda beside him (why a panda??) to explore the Silk Road.</p><p> </p><p>And then, I tried hard to read the map for the ruin of Changan, </p><p>the map made me feel that the ruin was a nice place surrounded by several small villages. </p><p>I got lost for a short period of time, but managed to find the place with no significant entrance.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010549_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The ruin entrance was like a local market, and the ruin itself made no difference than other villages and streets I had already seen. </p><p>As the matter of fact, there was no ruin whatsoever. What a pity! I had gone so far.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010555_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went back to the Muslim Quarter for a big lunch. On the recommended by friends, </p><p>I ordered very tasty sesame butter rice noodle, pan-fry jelly, pan-fry dumpling and ice cold dark plum juice.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010565_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The sesame butter rice noodle was sesame butter, julienned cucumber, and some red sauce (not spicy) over rice noodle. </p><p>The cold rice noodle was very Q like Taiwanese cold noodle, they were different though.</p><p>(Note: Q in Chinese means chewy in a positive/enjoyable way)</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010568_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The stir-fry jelly tasted like stir-fry daikon cake, </p><p>the jelly was very soft and broke easily if being squeezed harder – highly recommended!</p><p> </p><p>The pan-fry dumplings in Muslin style were different than what we had in Taiwan, </p><p>they got very thin crispy skin - quite unique!</p><p>The dark plum juice was infused and not from the powder mix. </p><p>It would be so nice if my water bottles could be filled with the juice every day. </p><p>I might not be able to find such good sour plum juice in Taiwan.</p><p>I would miss the food in the Muslim Quarter in Xian very much.</p><p> </p><p>As for the desert, I had rice cakes topped with sweet sauce. </p><p>Unlike most deserts, they were pretty new to me and very yummy. Each serving has two flavors for three RMB.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010571_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Before leaving the Muslim Quarter, I went to a Muslim bakery, buying various cakes, </p><p>such as crystal cakes, as the snacks on the road, eight RMB for one kilo of any kind of cake. </p><p>The bakery clerk helped me pick up a little bit of everything. </p><p>It felt great to spend fifteen dollars and fifty cents RMB for snacks. </p><p>Eating delicious cakes while biking would cheer me up and make my ride no longer a chore.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010573_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The afternoon sun was annoying; I had been looking for a hat with an adjustable visor over the past two days. </p><p>The visor could be pulled down as a shade to cover up the entire face, super effective in blocking afternoon sun. </p><p>I saw many bikers wearing them, but did not see them sold on street. </p><p><br />I even went to the wholesale clothing market to look for such a hat, searching in several buildings but not finding one. </p><p>It was discouraging, if I could not find it in Xian, it would be more difficult to find it on the road later.</p><p>When I got back to hotel, I asked the front desk man where I could find such hat. </p><p>What a coincident! Two doors down from the hotel was a hat shop which was closed because the afternoon sun as so scorching hot. </p><p>I could get the hat that I had expected for quite sometime when the shop reopened later.</p><p> </p><p>I always kept track of the number of ice pops that I had every day. </p><p>In the beginning, I wrote down two, later erased two and wrote down four… </p><p>After repeating several times, my notebook became very untidy. </p><p>For the sake of clean and easy, I changed the way of tracking it, and Chinese 正system was adopted. </p><p>Today I had five ice pops, exactly one 正.</p><p>(Note: 正has five strokes, one stroke stands for one ice pop, five ice pops complete the character)</p><p><br />Even though today was my reset day, I rode about sixty KM in and out the city, </p><p>not really had a rest. However, my knee did not hurt anymore. </p><p>I was not sick and had no diarrhea since I had arrived in China. </p><p>My warm up had been finished. After two rest days, </p><p>tomorrow was the beginning of the real challenge (looking forward to it)</p></div>
