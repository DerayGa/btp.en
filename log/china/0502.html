										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-11_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p>Strolling down the streets of Louyang in the morning, surprisingly, </p><p>you can’t find that restaurants open for breakfast. Wondering around, finally found a restaurant filled with steam from steamers.</p><p>I ordered a bowl of eight-treasure rice soup, according to the boss lady. </p><p>But it was not sweet at all : ( and they wouldn’t add sugar for me, either.</p><p>Also saw the steamers have steamed meat buns and they looked delicious. Asked for price, 0.4 RMB for 1 bun.</p><p>She brought me one tray and it had 10 buns. The boss lady asked me if I can finish them.</p><p>Can anyone eat 10 steamed buns first thing in the morning?</p><p>I ordered 5 of them. Plus a bowl of non-sweet eight-treasure rice soup for breakfast. Total 2.5 RMB.</p><p> </p><p>After breakfast, got on Dido and headed to bookstore, just like the travel agent said, to buy a map of Louyang. One map, 2 RMB. </p><p>That was a little bit expensive. It was just a piece of paper. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010010_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I asked the owner to mark my current location on the map. </p><p>This was just in case if I get lost and can’t find my way back to the hotel. That would be embarrassing.</p><p>Next, asked how to get to the old town of Louyang.</p><p>Come to find out the old town has become the “Sui Tang Dynasties Ruins Botanical Garden”</p><p> </p><p>Louyang is also known as ancient capital of nine dynasties. According to Chinese history, </p><p>there were at least thirteen dynasties, Xia, Shang, Eastern Zhou, Eastern Han, Cao Wei, West Jin, Norhtern Wei, Sui and Tang, </p><p>named Louyang as the capital. Louyang had been the capital for 1529 years and it is the oldest capital in Chinese history. </p><p> </p><p>Passed through a big bridge – Louyang Bridge with Lou River flow below it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010013_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010027_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Followed the map and found the entrance to the Old Town without any problem and it’s free!</p><p>I was excited and ready to get in. One of employees stopped me and said bicycles are not allowed inside and I have to leave it outside. </p><p>Well, how could I part with Dido? I could not leave him here and go inside by myself.</p><p>In that case, let’s say I have been here even though I stopped at the entrance.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010025_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I have been riding Dido all morning in downtown. There were a lot of buses and the city was well developed.</p><p>City landscape was very greenery and had a similar feeling as Ta-an district in Taipei.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010038_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>At 10:30, after wondering around, I was going to go to the White Horse Temple, a must visit tourist attraction. </p><p>But if they wouldn’t allow bicycles inside, I would have to stop at the entrance again and it would be ashamed.</p><p>So my plan was to take a bus in the afternoon so it wouldn’t be a waste of trip.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010044_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I saw a cute little girl riding backward on her mom’s bike. Actually this is very scary. </p><p>Those who have ridden backward on motorcycles would know.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010046_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the side walk, there were many old men playing Chinese chess. </p><p>All the pieces were huge and there were a lot of audiences.</p><p>Here, evidently the rule of bystanders are not allowed to give any suggestions didn’t exists. </p><p>Everyone had his own option on what the next move should be and they were very excited about it.</p><p>They weren’t afraid to give any tactical advices. Some were even cursing unrelentingly if a bad move was made. </p><p>That’s because the rule of can not retracting a move is still valid here.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010051_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the way back to the hotel, I bought a roast chicken (15 RMB). Just by looking at it made my mouth watering.</p><p>The same restaurant also sells hot and spicy rabbit meat. But I wouldn’t dare to eat bunnies.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010054_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just have chicken seems to be strange, </p><p>so I stopped by the restaurant I went to this morning and bought some vegetable buns to go with the chicken. </p><p>Vegetable and meat buns are the same price, 0.4 RMB. But obviously the vegetable ones are much bigger.</p><p>One tray of steamer can fit 10 meat buns and still has plenty of space left. But it can only fit 7 vegetable buns.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010055_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Back to the hotel and enjoyed my lunch and then took a nap. I could have a leisure afternoon….</p><p> </p><p>Woke up at 2:00, took a bottle of Pepsi and got on bus number 58. </p><p>Bus fare for one-way is 1.5 RMB. We headed toward the White Horse Temple. </p><p>Louyand buses announce the stop name after arriving at each stop so it is very difficult to get lost.</p><p>You can pay cash or use something similar to metro cards. Who says China is falling behind?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010058_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The bus ride was about half hour. </p><p>Along the temple were all vendors and their signs were all consistent with blank background and yellow characters. </p><p>Even though there were a lot of vendors, but every thing were well organized.</p><p>Also surprisingly, there were many trash cans and cleaning crews. </p><p>It was very clean and it made people to fall in love with it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010061_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I bought a ticket for 35 RMB. And bikes are not allowed here. Luckily I took a bus….Whew………</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010066_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I was at outside, I saw a lot of tourists. After went inside and there were even more.</p><p>The White Horse Temple is the first Buddhist temple built in China. </p><p>For devoted Buddhist believers here would be considered a holy place they have to visit at least once in their lifetime.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010083_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There were so many incenses burning that they were burning in flame.</p><p>The whole combustible base was filled with burning incenses.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010141_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If you have enough people in a group, you can ask one of the masters from the temple to give you a tour. </p><p>Because I was by myself, so I just blended right into other people’s group and listened to the stories about the White Horse Temple.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010073_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A long time ago, some one dreamed of a ramble of thunders or something like that. </p><p>He took it as a sign and walked toward the west.</p><p>He ran into two monks from Indian at Afghanistan, so he invited them to China to preach and translate Buddhist text.</p><p>People built this temple for these two monks. </p><p>Because the Buddhist text was carried by a white horse, they named this temple after the white horse.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010134_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This story might sound boring at the beginning. </p><p>But this event took place in East Han Dynasty (25 AD to 220 AD), five or six hundred years prior to Xuanzang. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010101_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The master who was giving us a tour is named Miaotian (same name as the con artist in Taiwan)</p><p>He was first trained in Shaolin Monastery. He then went to Xiangguo Temple and now stays at White Horse Temple.</p><p>There are over a hundred monks in the White Horse Temple learning Buddhism </p><p>and hoping one day they will relieve the suffering in reincarnation.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010149_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The master asked me where I am from. </p><p>This is the first time I told the truth that I am from Taiwan.</p><p>After found out that I am traveling by bike, he asked where I was staying. </p><p>This is because he can help me to find a spot to stay in White Horse Temp. And for FREE …. : )</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, I have to leave Louyang tomorrow. </p><p>Otherwise, I could have an opportunity to stay overnight at the White Horse Temple. </p><p>Waking up early in the morning, attending morning session with the masters, </p><p>saying the prayers and then hitting the bell and drum at the bell tower for 108 times, which represents elimination of 108 temptations.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010172_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The White Hoarse Temple is not just a single architecture structure. </p><p>After several renovations and expansions, there are several halls, including Mahavira Hall, Main Hall, Hall of Great Buddha…, etc.</p><p>Today, Mahavira Hall worships Buddha statues that were made by the lost of ancient technique.</p><p>Because they are very precious national treasures, lights are not allowed inside and not opened to public.</p><p>Visitors can only observe from outside.</p><p> </p><p>The master said that Gautama Buddha always brought Ananda, one of his disciples, to his sermons. </p><p>Why Ananda?</p><p>Because Ananda had a very good memory and he could remember every word the Gautama Buddha said at his sermons. </p><p>A lot of text we read today was written by him. We should thank him for his good memory.</p><p> </p><p>The legend said that when the Gautama Buddha was teaching at his sermons, he would also bring along 2 fairies. </p><p>When he talked about something very interesting, these two fairies would fly up into the sky and spread flower petals. </p><p>This is where the phrase “flying goddess spread flowers” came from.</p><p>I don’t know why, but when I heard the story, it reminded me of Aju and Ahua </p><p>(two of background singers and dancers of a famous Taiwanese singer)</p><p> </p><p>Listened to the master explaining the temple to us, everything was so new to me and they were very interesting. </p><p>Sitting under the rooftop of the temple and drinking free hot tea, it almost made me feel that I want to become a monk.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010158_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Along the temple are two tombs. There several thousands years old sacred relics from monks inside the tombs. </p><p>I wondered if they were from the two Indian monks that were stopped at Afghanistan. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010182_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are many bamboos and fragrant irises planted around the tombs. Very beautiful ~</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1010174_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After spending two hours here, I am still not getting enough. </p><p>35 RMB for a ticket is definitely worth it. People who are interested in Buddhism should be very touched if they are here.</p><p>I saw several older female visitors were kowdowing from the first statue of Guan Yin to the last statue of Gautama Buddha</p><p> </p><p>Back to downtown, dinner was the vegetarian duns bought at the lunch time. One day in Louyang ended too quickly.</p><p>Tomorrow, I will continue head toward Xi’an. If everything goes well, I should be there in two to three days.</p><p><br /></p>
