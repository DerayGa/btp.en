										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-56_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Being staying up late these days, my daily routine was somewhat messed up,</span></p><p>I used to sleep at 9:00ish pm, get up at 5:00ish am and then be ready to set off.</p><p>Now, not going to bed until 2 or 3 am, it was hard to drag myself out of bed in the morning. </p><p>If managing to get up early, I would feel off the whole day. </p><p>If sleeping in, I would arrive in the destination late and end up with the late cycle again.</p><p>Moreover, the sun and the time zone confused me totally. </p><p> </p><p>My watch still stayed in Taiwan time zone. Kazakhstan about 400 km away was two hours behind my current time zone.</p><p>Sun went down at 10:30pm in west Xinjiang. With that said, the sun would go down at 8:30pm in Kazakhstan.</p><p>The different time zones screwed me up. Hopefully I could adjust it.</p><p> </p><p>Breakfasting at Hangzhou Steam Bun recommended by the hotel owner, a basket of yummy buns and savory tofu pudding, </p><p>I preferred sweet tofu pudding, the savory one tasted like sweet and sour soup.</p><p>[Note: tofu pudding is known as douhua or doufunao]</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060101_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>By the time the breakfast was finished, it had been 10:00am. </p><p>I was about 500 km far from the border. My Kazakhstan visa would take effect on June 24. </p><p>Even if I arrived at the border early, I still could not enter Kazakhstan early.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060104_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>No solid plan for today, either riding casually toward the border or keeping up my regular pace </p><p>and getting into the border early and fully resting before entering Kazakhstan.</p><p>Anyway, let’s get going. I would ride as far as I could and stop if feeling tired. </p><p>I was repeatedly asked by the same question: “Don’t you get tired by the long ride?”</p><p>“No ~ Why ? I rest when tired, eat when hungry, sleep when dark. I am carefree by myself”</p><p>With the same spirit, I would ride as far as I could today ~</p><p> </p><p>Dido was up on the bridge, what was I doing down below?</p><p>Oh, well, there were things you could not hold -- I drank too much …..</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060105_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Passing many little rivers with chocolate brown water along the way,</p><p>I wondered something went wrong in their headstreams that muddied the water?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060103_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After Urumqi some place names did not sound and feel like Chinese, </p><p>such as Hutubi and Manasi since they were translated phonetically to Chinese.</p><p>I rolled out of Dafen town and reached Manasi at noon with ease. </p><p>From here on, these huge chimneys appeared in every town like accessories.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060114_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I ordered a bowl of meat ball soup in the suburb because I just had breakfast at 10:00am, a bowl of meat ball soup should be fine for lunch. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060112_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It turned out that a set meal was served. The restaurant owner must get it wrong, </p><p>so I repeated my order and why other dishes were served?</p><p>The meat ball soup came with two free wowotou and a free appetizer. </p><p>[Note: wowotou is multi-grain steam bun]</p><p>The appetizer was tomato, onion and bell pepper salad with a pinch of hot spice.</p><p>The soup had quite a few sliced lamb meats that were fancier than what I ever had before. The lunch filled my up.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060116_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It was my habit consulting people for travel information, </p><p>such as the road condition or travel distance which was like RPG game asking pass-by people for information. </p><p>I did it just for fun when playing computer game and always skipped the conversation.</p><p>In the real life, sometimes I started a chat for the sake of conversation, </p><p>and did not really care about the content unless it would have impact on me.</p><p>The man taking a rest by the door in the restaurant during lunch was incredibly misleading. </p><p>Shihezi was about 10 km away, but he told me it was about 50 km away.</p><p>My China atlas with a blue cover had mailed back to Taiwan in Urumqi. </p><p>The one I had was bought in Urumqi still good enough for the rest of the trip.</p><p>I thought I made a mistake, digging the map out and checking it up. </p><p>I was sure that the serious looking man was bluffing.</p><p>For my next question how far from Huoerguosi here, he said another 800 km but the truth was 400 km.</p><p>Bluffing like that, weren’t you afraid of getting a liar’s long nose?</p><p> </p><p>It reminded me that a few days ago in somewhere I was asked what to do if getting lost.</p><p>My answer was asking around. There would be always somebody to help out. </p><p>The owner wanted me to be watchful since someone might bluff me and send me to the opposite direction.</p><p>I had not met a single bluffer along the way except that Uncle Pinocchio.</p><p> </p><p>I took a nap by the door till 1:00pm or so when the youngest son of the store owner came back. </p><p>He was curious about Dido so we had a brief conversation.</p><p>He was having a high school entrance examination in three days, if passed, </p><p>he would move to Jichang, the city that I rode through the other day, and attend a boarding school.</p><p>Regardless the result, right after the test, he would ride with his friends to Urumqi to relax themselves.</p><p>I had been there and knew the feeling when preparing my own high school entrance exam. </p><p>Back then, nothing was worth doing except study.</p><p>Study was only for exam, and exam was for getting into another school to continue education.</p><p>I gladly failed the high school entrance exam that gave me the chance to meet my good friends in the five year junior college.</p><p>The days in my junior college were the happiest time of my school days. The key was being independent at the boarding school.</p><p>I seriously told him to do his best. Once passed, he could start a bright new life! </p><p>He said be careful to me and I wished him a good luck with his exam – I left at 2:00pm.</p><p> </p><p>Shortly after Manasi I passed through Shihezi without detouring into the downtown and continued toward the west. </p><p>The next town Shawan was 30 km away followed by Kuytun100 km away.</p><p>I was thinking to get to Shawan and call it a day. If riding for another 100 km, it would be overdone.</p><p>Along the way, the number one beautiful scenery was the changeful clouds in the sky.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060146_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>No cloud was right above my head, they were over the mountains in the distance</p><p>It seemed that the clouds were too lazy to float in the sky but stayed low at the foothill – very laid back clouds.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060133_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The road was unusually no longer lined with restaurants or auto repair shops but flower nurseries, </p><p>one nursery next to another. Shawan was a flower town.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060126_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then, I pulled into Huayuan town, a beautiful name. </p><p>It had a good looking entrance and big buses were not allowed. I toured the town in flower scent on Dido.</p><p>[Note: Huayuan in Chinese means Garden]</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060129_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>At about 4:30pm I arrived in Shawan feeling looking for a hotel and calling it a day. </p><p>Then I would go to bed earlier tonight and get up earlier the morning after. However, the other part of me felt like riding a bit more.</p><p>There was no such thing - “a bit more”. If not staying in Shawan tonight, I would have to ride another 4 hours to get to the next city.</p><p> </p><p>The other frequently asked question was “why don’t you find a riding companion?”</p><p>Riding alone is carefree – I can eat whatever I want to eat, go where I want to go, </p><p>and rest whenever I felt like to. Time would not be spent on discussion and compromise. </p><p> </p><p>That reminded me of Natu. It was my first time riding with a companion. I really did not know how to get along with her.</p><p>At meal time, we passed one restaurant next to another till reached the end, but still could not decide which place to go.</p><p>Finally a place was picked then we had to decide which table to sit, by the window or by the door.</p><p>The worst part was ordering, eating separately or sharing? Did she has eating taboo? </p><p> </p><p>That was only about eating. If taking accommodation, destination, rest time, </p><p>rest spots, riding routes, riding speed and even how to handle money into account, </p><p>I would either kill myself or murder my companion and buried the dead body in the desert to clean up the crime evidences. </p><p> </p><p>Being alone was excellent! 10 seconds of thinking, I decided to continue on, completely free of arguing.</p><p>Even though I pushed on, there was no need to push on to Kuytun. I could stop at anytime as long as there was an accommodation.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060158_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In addition to farmers, ranchers and many factories in this area, it also had coal mine. </p><p>Luckily, there was no coal trunk running around and kicking up coal dust.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060110_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Usually I would find a hotel before dinner, today I did dinner first and then continued my ride. </p><p>In the suburb of Shawan, I had stir-fried noodles at a muslin restaurant which won’t catch your eyes. </p><p>It seemed that if I did not ride into Kuytun there would be no accommodation along the road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060151_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>40 km to ride after dinner - Today I had plenty of exercise after all three meals, hopefully that won’t did damage to my stomach.</p><p>I stocked up on snacks before dinner to get ready. </p><p>Since my bags were crowded with new supplies, I had to stuff the snacks into my coat packets.</p><p>I would get something from my pocket when craving goodie. </p><p>It felt like Doraemon that I could conjure practical tools out of my pocket.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060153_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>[Note: Doraemon is a Japanese manga series about a robotic cat named Doraemon </p><p>who possesses a fourth-dimensional pocket from which he can produce futuristic tools and gadgets]</p><p>All other customers in the restaurant had been to Huoerguosi that seemed normal </p><p>because Huoerguosi was no far from here. Everybody said Huoerguosi was a big city.</p><p>In my imagination, border was an endless tall wall studded with barbed wire </p><p>with immigration officers equipped with loaded guns at the border-crossing gate.</p><p>The border surrounding should be arid and barren and could not be busy and bustling. My imagination seemed totally wrong.</p><p>I had never seen a border in my life. </p><p>Without being in Huoerguosi and seeing with my own eyes, I won’t have an idea what a border would look like. </p><p> </p><p>The information from the restaurant owner was much accurate </p><p>and practical than the Uncle Pinocchio which was 9 km of uphill, 9 km of downhill and then flat road all the way to Kuytun?</p><p>The downtown Kuytun was not on the main road, </p><p>but there were many accommodations and restaurants along the main road. It was ok not to get into the downtown.</p><p> </p><p>It was estimated to arrive in Kuytun by 10:00pm. </p><p>The sun came down around 10:30 pm and the sky was still bright at 10:00pm so I was not under pressure by riding in dark.</p><p>The road condition was exactly as the restaurant owner described. I arrived at the bustling area along the main road. </p><p>After checking in a hotel, I would be able to take a sponge shower and do my laundry.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060168_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The air here was not as dry as the Gobi desert in Gansu, more humid. </p><p>Therefore, my clothes were wet with sweat. If I did not wash them everyday, they smelled like picked cabbage the next day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1060175_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The hotel owner was very nice who let me have a room accommodating </p><p>four to myself even though there was space available in another room.</p><p>I felt a bit embarrassed when handing over only 15 RMB for such spacious room. </p><p>I would restore the room before checking out. Thanked the owner who let me sleep well and worry free.</p><p><br /></p>
