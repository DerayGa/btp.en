thought no one would wake up early for work, so I let myself sleep until 7am.  </span></p><p>I slept soundly in the tent for 9 hours, then I wondered how come it is very loud outside, </p><p>after getting out of the tent I realized it was Saturday today. </p><p> </p><p>I estimate I will arrive at my destination on September 12, 2008, </p><p>counting the days, if lucky; it will be in Paris next Wednesday.  Then the long trip will end.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180784_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Once I start missing home the time starts to pass slowly, if not counting today, </p><p>just count from the Germany/France border, just 3.5 more days riding to Paris.  </p><p>It is scary counting the days backwards.  After collecting all my things, this is my last day in Germany. </p><p> </p><p>It is hard to determine whether today’s weather is good or bad, but at least it didn’t start raining when I got up.  </p><p>But the clouds are covered with dark clouds, just the same as every other day. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180786_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I had though I need to hurry to finish the last day in Germany, </p><p>but after studying the map last night I found I am not very far from the border, but I had thought I am in the middle of Germany.  </p><p> </p><p>After getting into Germany, there wasn’t a day I didn’t get lost, </p><p>turning east and west but at least I am getting going towards the southwest.  </p><p> </p><p>But too bad I rode too much extra road.  Before I left, </p><p>I found another place to write the travel journal, this looks like some activity center that hasn’t opened for the day yet. </p><p> </p><p>After finishing writing the travel journal, I used wireless Internet to get the journal online.  </p><p>I absolutely love the fact Europe has high Internet coverage.  </p><p>I can say as long as there are homes, there is Internet coverage. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180791_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two photos, some small paragraph, but I spent the whole morning doing this; it was noon by the time I left.  </p><p>I kept thinking since I am not far from the border, no hurry, I can get there easily.  </p><p>Yes, it isn’t far away, about 100km (62 miles) but the path isn’t that easy. </p><p> </p><p>Minus getting lost, finding my way, getting around, and asking for direction, it isn’t easy at all. </p><p>As soon as I get into the city, I will be in panic mode.  </p><p>Even if I follow signs, I will still get lost.  I go around all the way, but I will end up in the same spot.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180799_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>People in south Germany is very friendly, it has been a long time since people cheered for me when I ride the bike. </p><p>This is because in Europe, there are so many people like me traveling through on their bicycle.  </p><p>Everyday I will see at least a dozen people like me.  But the funny thing is, no one will stop and chit chats.  </p><p>There is just time left for passing by, nodding the head and smile,</p><p>if I meet them in either Russia or Kazakhstan, then it will be totally different.</p><p> </p><p>The map Peter gives me is very useful, but it is only for the big roads.  </p><p>A lot of roads are cars only which is not shown on the map.  </p><p>Then I will sigh when I get on the bike, opening the map and trying to figure out how can I go around this path,</p><p>trying to find substitute roads for bicycles only.  </p><p>Good thing the signs are very clear, city names, distance, direction, as clear as the road signs, </p><p>but it is hard to determine which ones are bicycle allowed path.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180800_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>They are not as clear as normal path; they are usually mixed with country roads, small bridges, and path between homes. </p><p>The worst thing is even though the signs are straight line, but when I ride it they aren’t straight but with twists and turns. </p><p>Besides, the bicycle lanes connect to each other, and I can’t determine which direction I am supposes to go. </p><p> </p><p>Tons of cross roads, but generally there are no signs for those cross roads. </p><p>So every time I get away from the big roads, started using bicycle only path, </p><p>then the light inside me will tell me be ready to get lost, and the map won’t be any help either.  </p><p> </p><p>This is because bicycle paths are too small, the maps don’t show them, </p><p>so the only way to get out of the bicycle path maze is asking other bicycle rides or runners on the road. </p><p>Tomorrow is Sunday; all the stores will be closed.  </p><p> </p><p>On Saturday, there will be Farmer’s market, it looks very festive, </p><p>and they look like they are ready to close now, so the goods will be cheaper.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180802_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Taking the last working day to shop for some items in the grocery store. </p><p>I need to purchase today and tomorrow’s food, so 2 days worth of money I can spend.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180806_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I purchased 1 loaf of bread, some Prince chocolate cookie that I had purchased before, and some layered chocolate cookies.  </p><p> </p><p>The items at the grocery store are huge packages, so I should be ok eating those foods for 2 days.  </p><p>When I got lost I passed by an airplane museum, they aren’t showing some old planes, but some very new passenger jet planes.  </p><p>There are lots of people waiting in line to go inside. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180809_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I realized I passed by this place twice, because after I got lost, I came back again. </p><p> </p><p>I had thought I left the city, but I didn’t get out of it, so I tried another path.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180811_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the map, they use gray to signal city center, but the roads aren’t not shown in the map. </p><p>Actually this is good; otherwise the map will be too packed. </p><p>Ideally, it would be good to find the “i” sign when entering the city, </p><p> </p><p>otherwise then I will have to use luck to get out of the city. </p><p>I took some big road earlier, turning around now I use bicycle path only, did you see the green bicycle signs? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180812_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Those roads are only for pedestrian and bicycle only, the view from the top of the bridge. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180818_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ducks and more ducks, I shared a piece of toast with them. </p><p>But since I am counting all my food rations, so please consider I couldn’t share too much with you.  </p><p>I will be grateful if you can sacrifice one of you guys for me. </p><p> </p><p>I will see some yellow machine in the entrance of the city, on it says “SIE FAHREN”, </p><p>at first I didn’t know what it means, but every time I pass it there will be number showing. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180820_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But it doesn’t look like a thermometer, after looking at it for a while I realized it is speedometer.  </p><p>This allows the driver entering the town to be aware how fast they are driving, so the driver will slow down.  </p><p> </p><p>Currently my speed is 15km/hour (9.315 miles/hour), after discovering what it is I rode back and forth few times,</p><p>I am curious how it works.  Some random picture, one needs to be careful in Germany,</p><p>from planes, snows, and now even frogs.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180822_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Some unknown plant, there is reddish purple flowers, but no fruit, about 1.5m, the farmer is currently harvesting. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180823_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I feel special riding on bicycle lane today passing through fields. </p><p>Regardless what it is, they plant fields of everything, including radish, and it is planted on the whole field. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180825_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And all the radish plant is huge, yesterday I told Peter I have the urge to steal them when I saw them yesterday, </p><p>but I wouldn’t know how to cook them after I get them.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180826_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Entering the city again, and facing a cop.  The motorcycle cop stopped all the cars on the road, even myself on the bicycle, </p><p>he signed me to stop on the side of the road.  After the motorcycle cop is the car cop, wow, and the whole road with no car. </p><p>In Taiwan, this means some politician is passing through, but in Germany why would they need to stop everyone?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180828_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After the cop then comes a Smart car, behind it are roller skaters.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180829_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are so many of them, about 300 or so, they all line up passing through, looks very dramatic.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180832_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I took out the camera the passing by skaters will say hi, signaling the peace V sign, they look so happy. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180836_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So many people, how many people are there exactly?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180834_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Still not finished, it is like a lightening activity, suddenly lots of people, all skaters, and then suddenly all disappeared. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180838_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The last one following is an ambulance, and then another cop car. </p><p>The cops aren’t opening the road for some politicians, but ones who are enjoying sporting events. </p><p> </p><p>Every time when I pass by trees with fruit I will go see if there is anything I can eat.  </p><p>The left black fruit should be blueberry, the reddish one on the right I am not sure what it is.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180841_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The elementary school teacher taught me right, if I am not sure what it is, and then I shouldn’t put it in my mouth.  </p><p>I will see tons of farm type things in the market, but how come I can’t find those fields outside?  </p><p> </p><p>All the fruit I picked ended up being apples, this is probably because I only know apples. </p><p>I am not eating very healthy lately, so I should pick some apples for food.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180846_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are lots of varieties of apples; this type is different from the type I picked before. </p><p>All the ones here are red, very small, looks like some sweet apples. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180847_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I picked a few apples that looked good putting them in my pocket.  </p><p>Before I eat them, I will have to remember to wipe them on my pants for cleanness. </p><p>I am very proud that I still remember basic hygiene, I found I haven’t washed this pants for a week.  </p><p> </p><p>The street lamps here must not be cold; there are lots of Morning Glory plants growing on it.  </p><p>When the flowers bloom, the street lamp will become a huge bouquet of flowers.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180844_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The cities in Germany will have signs by the entrance displaying the name.  </p><p>There will also be small letters underneath, just like a description, using 5 or 6 words describing this town’s specialty.  </p><p> </p><p>This town’s specialty is walls.  Looking at the road passing through the walls then you will know why,</p><p>there are 2 small doors on the left and right for pedestrian and cyclist to pass through. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180849_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>There are lots of tracks for this train station, so this must be a big stop.  </p><p>Continuing riding toward the west, then I will enter towns with TGV. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180850_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Right now I am lost, I had just asked direction from another cyclist.  </p><p>But the guy said he had just moved here earlier, and he is doesn’t know directions either. </p><p>I said that is ok, you can just pick a random direction; this is because I have been unlucky lately.  </p><p>Good thing the guy picked the correct one, I left the town successfully.</p><p> </p><p>Another time on the bridge I asked a couple for direction, they said just turn right ahead to get out of the town. </p><p>So I thought I understood and then waved good-bye. </p><p>After I got off the bridge turned left I met the same couple again. </p><p>The couple used hand signal to tell me I took the wrong turn, I should have turn the other direction.  </p><p>I am total lost between left and right, but I can ride this far on my own. </p><p>I don’t get lost all the time, just sometimes, so this is amazing for me to get this far. </p><p> </p><p>  Even though riding bicycle only lanes makes feel I will get lost even more,</p><p>but everyone time when I see bicycle only lanes I have ride on it, </p><p>this is because the bike feels it is being respected for riding on it.  </p><p>Here I can usually see the local cyclist that are nodding, weaving and smiling at me.  </p><p>So the whole day I see lots of smiling Germans.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180852_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Every 10km (6.2 miles) or so, I will get into a new city, and then my trouble comes.  </p><p>This time the town is hosting the music festival, so all the roads are closed. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180855_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Close off road is fine, but at least hang a U sign to let me know how I can go around these roads.  </p><p>The festival location is at the city center, where all the big roads meets so I must crossing by here, but I am denied to pass through.  </p><p> </p><p>So I randomly trying to pass through, riding to the outskirts I see this map. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180856_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I came from the north, I need to go toward south, but now I am on the road on the right.  </p><p>If I continue to ride, I don’t know where I will be.  So I ended up riding for no reason,</p><p>I need to get back to the town with the road blocked off.  </p><p>Since I am not allowed to pass through the big roads, then I will have to find bicycle lanes to pass through.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180857_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Going back to the music festival location, looking at the stage and the lots of food stands.  </p><p>Even the blocked off road have tons of tables and chairs set up, everyone are eating and drinking beer.  </p><p>It isn’t that I don’t have money; I just don’t have Euro on me.  </p><p>After saving my money living thrifty for a week, I am getting used to it.  </p><p>My eyes no longer look for hotel and restaurant signs.  </p><p>But looking at lots of wonderful food in front of me, plate after plate, </p><p>with the tourist eating all of it, this really blows my ego for trying to save money.  </p><p>So I opened the chocolate cookies to eat, this way I won’t get so hungry.  Looking at people eating good food is my weakness. </p><p> </p><p>In order to get to the France/Germany border, I need to ride on the bicycle only lane, </p><p>this is because all the big streets forbidden bicycles.  </p><p>However the road conditions are very different.  When I cross the forest the ground is dirt road.  </p><p>But since I had just changed to new tires, it is easy to ride on dirt road. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180866_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But which road should I take?  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180869_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The place I am going is called Ettlingen, the sign points to the right,</p><p>but there is no right at this crossroads, so I randomly picked one directly.  </p><p> </p><p>Then at the next crossroad I found all 3 signs says Ettlingen, so which way should I take?  </p><p>Looking at where the sun is setting, it is right going toward the west.  </p><p>Even though the bicycle lanes are this hard to figure out, there should be way to get on the correct road even with some twist and turns.  </p><p> </p><p>After passing through the forest I saw the big road underneath, leading toward the place I am going to. </p><p>There are motorcycles on the road, but it does not allow bicycles, very not fair.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180871_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After passing through this sky bridge I will get into another forest.  </p><p>I kept asking for directions from people who seem nice, but the answer I got are all the same. </p><p>I can get there regardless which direction I take.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180872_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just then an older couple walking out of the forest, they are picking walnuts while walking, all wrapped up in some napkins.  </p><p>They give all the walnuts to me.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180874_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had thought walnuts need to be cooked first, but apparently walnuts can be eaten raw. </p><p>I used my foot to crush the hard shell, the inside nut is white, yummy, and healthy. </p><p>Free food coming my way.  This couple also told me I could get to Ettlingen regardless which direction I take,</p><p>so I decided to ask another way. </p><p> </p><p>Which direction do I need to take to get to France?  Just one answer for this, going toward west. </p><p>Finally passing through the thick forest, back on the paved road, </p><p>however there are no street sign here just like bicycle lanes.</p><p><img

had thought I needed to sleep inside the forest tonight; the thought had worried me earlier. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180882_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But I saw sunset today, the sun already gone down for the day.  </p><p>The clouds look like it will break, I will see in the next few days if the weather will get better.  </p><p> </p><p>Because I took bicycle lanes today so I got lost quit a bit,</p><p>but because I am taking the bicycle lanes I can cross through those no bike roads.  </p><p> </p><p>If there is a map of bicycle lanes on hand, then riding in Germany will be God send.  </p><p>Because I had gotten lost, so I didn’t get a chance to enter France today, but at least I am getting toward the border.  </p><p> </p><p>Right now I am in between Germany and France, a river separates the two countries.  </p><p>Tomorrow I will need to figure out how to cross the river, either by boat or whatever.  </p><p>Then after getting into France, I will need to climb some mountains that will waste a day. </p><p>There is about 400km (248 miles) left from where I am straight to Paris, but riding a bike is about 500km (310 miles) or so. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/map-2_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="469" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If takes 3.5 days to ride, then each day I need to ride at least 150km (93 miles).  </p><p>Right now I am following my original plan to reach Paris.  </p><p>If once I enter France I can’t update the travel blogs that means I don’t have 3-4 hours of free time every day to write the travel blogs.  </p><p> </p><p>Today’s blog I am able to finish before going to bed, this is because I found store that is closed.  </p><p>Sitting on the bench in front of the store wrapped up in the sleeping bag and typing on the laptop, I will sleep here tonight. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180890_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The safety in Europe is not much worry, 99% of the people are wealthier than I am, what is the point robbing a poor man?  </p><p>Tomorrow I will have the whole day to ride the bike, after I wake up it will be the start of France.</p><p><br /></p>
