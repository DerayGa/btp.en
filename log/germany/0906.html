everything up to the second floor and placed everything for the night,</span></p><p>I found there is a window that leads to the street,and the window doesn’t have any glass on it.  </p><p>This means if there is someone that comes in here in the middle of the night, they can easily get into this house. </p><p>For safety reason, I purposely found some wood sticks and blocks off the window.  </p><p>So if someone comes in they will hit those wood sticks, and wakes me up from my sleep.  </p><p>The safety procedure is just in case, good thing the whole night was fine, slept until morning. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180576_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Outside ground is a bit wet; maybe there is some rain last night.  </p><p>By the time the sun came up today, it had stopped raining, and seems like the weather today is much better than the last few days.  </p><p>Since I can get out from the second floor, there is no need to move the bike to the downstairs area. </p><p>I can get out from the 2nd floor window; just one trip takes care of it all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180577_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I left this empty house, walking to the quiet neighborhood, it was still very quiet around 7:30am, </p><p>very few pedestrians and cars on the road. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180579_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The first thing I did wasn’t tried to ride more, but go back to the grocery store from last night.  </p><p>There is a free electric plug next to the cart area; I need to finish writing the travel journal today before I leave. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180580_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After getting into different countries, the places I write travel journals change as well,</p><p>from the hotel bed to the tables at the restaurant, </p><p>and now I am sitting on the ground in front of a grocery store typing away. </p><p> </p><p>I still have half load of bread and half package of cookies left from yesterday, </p><p>I am eating those things for breakfast while I write the travel journal. </p><p>The more I eat, the thirstier I get, but I don’t have any water I can drink. </p><p>The water in the water bottle tastes funny; so I can only use it to wipe my face, </p><p>I don’t want to drink this water regardless how thirsty I am. </p><p>Since it is the grocery store next door, then I can buy some beverages, it has been awhile since I spent money to buy beverages. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180581_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After comparing prices for a while, I found regardless which country, </p><p>they all have similar things to Coca Cola, and the prices are cheap as well.  </p><p>This is the same in Germany, 1.5L (6.3 cups) of soda just $0.39 Euro ($0.60USD), </p><p>so even if in China money (RMB), this is still very cheap. </p><p>I picked out a bottle each of cola and orange soda, I calculated two bottles being $0.78Euro ($1.17USD), </p><p>but when I checked out the cashier charged me $1.28Euro ($1.92USD). </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180583_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Very confusingly I paid for the sodas, and then looking at the receipt to see why they charge me $0.50Euro more ($0.75USD).  </p><p>And really, the store does show each bottle is $0.39 Euro, </p><p>but every bottle I bought on the receipt it shows a fee for “EW-PFAND 1-ER” which costs $0.25Euro.  </p><p>I didn’t buy this item, so why is this item on the receipt?  </p><p>This is not possible for shopping bag charge either because I didn’t get a shopping bag.  </p><p>The more I thought the weirder it gets, the only ting I can think of is purchasing single bottle is more expensive.  </p><p>I explained to myself that at the store each bottle is $0.39Euro, and the bottle is in a pack of four,</p><p>so it is ok to buy just one bottle, except when you buy just one bottle it is $0.25 Euro more. </p><p>This sounds like some random excuse, like I just got fooled, then I wasted all that time comparing prices inside, </p><p>for $0.39Euro plus the $0.25Euro fee, this is not cheaper than any other soda.  </p><p>(Note: the $0.25Euro is for bottle deposit fee, or commonly called recycle fee). </p><p> </p><p>Looking at this receipt for a while, twisting open the soda cap, drinking the cola and eating my toast for breakfast.  </p><p>I am just 1/3 done with the travel blog, there are lots more to write.  </p><p>Sitting in front of the store to write the travel blog, it is getting toward noon, </p><p>and there are more people coming to shop, but no one is taking an interest to me. </p><p>As long as the store workers don’t kick me away, I don’t mind anyone watching me. </p><p> </p><p>In the early morning the sun came out, I got warm in the sun, I regret why I didn’t try to ride then,</p><p>and spend this time to write the travel blogs.  </p><p>I didn’t leave until 11am in the morning, so if I am trying to ride more lately, </p><p>then I will wait to write the travel blogs when I get to Paris, I am putting my traveling first.</p><p> </p><p>By the time I left, the sun has disappeared again, the sky has turned dark, and very foggy inside the mountain, I am not sure if it is raining or foggy. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180587_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After leaving the store for 5km, I saw a gas station.  </p><p>Out of habit I will ride around the gas station for a bit, but the bathroom here cost money, so I can’t get water to drink.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180588_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Although the bathroom cost money, but the gas station provides free Internet connection, I found another place to get online.  </p><p>Through the window I see there is electric plug-in inside but no plug-in outside. </p><p>Since I don’t have electricity backup, I quickly updated my travel blogs online. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180589_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Good thing there is no plug-in and Internet, otherwise I wouldn’t ride at all today. </p><p>I already spent this morning sitting in front of the store writing travel blogs, </p><p>and I would likely to spend the whole afternoon here at the gas station getting on the Internet.  </p><p> </p><p>When I left the gas station the weather didn’t change much, after riding into the mountain, </p><p>I found those white clouds, it is a mix of fog and freezing rainwater.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180592_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The weather is a bit strange, normally for September, Germany should be warm, no reason to be so cold right now.  </p><p> </p><p>When I purchased soda this morning I was only thinking of comparing prices, I didn’t consider any health information. </p><p>Looking at the cow eating grass, I thought I should have bought some milk to drink for health reasons. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180594_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>When I saw bike only path, it would be good to ride on them even though the normal road doesn’t prohibit bikes,</p><p>but it feels better to ride on bike only road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180596_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are few special things about the bikes only road in Germany: </p><p>First, you can see bikes only path anywhere, regardless whether in cities or country side, </p><p>the rights of the cyclist is regarded special in Germany.  </p><p>Second, they are beautiful; the people who plan bike paths are genius,</p><p>not only are the bike path follows the normal road, and are flat, but the views are also beautiful.  </p><p>Third, very ridiculous, a lot of time when I ride half way the bike path will disappear, </p><p>and end up in the field.  At first I think it is funny, then I got used to it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180631_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because the bike path are unique and special, sometimes I am not sure if I am lost or if I am touring the fields. </p><p>In situations like this, I need to see if there are signs that say whether this is a bike lane.  </p><p>As long as there is a bike lane sign, then it means the road was designed like this, </p><p>the betters ones will even show distance to the next place and where it is going.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180607_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>I didn’t start riding until around noon today, so I wasn’t sure how far I could ride today.  </p><p>But I just hope I can ride as much as I can today, I shouldn’t have taking lots of nice riding time to write the travel journals. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180597_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I entered this town I was a bit in shock, all the streets have X marks over them.  </p><p>What is it then?  Is the street ahead completely gone?  </p><p>My goal today is Wurzburg; it is also one of the places that got an X mark over it.  </p><p>Since the street marker say I can’t get there, then I will just enter this city and trying to find other paths I can take.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180598_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The stone paved road is very pretty and elegant, although it isn’t made for bicycle to ride over. </p><p>If riding on the pedestrian path on the side, then I need to be careful not running into store signs or displays.  </p><p>After crossing through this town I found the correct road, and the sky is clearing up as well.  </p><p>Looking at the dark clouds disappearing is a great feeling. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180624_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though all the temperatures are around 10C, but under the cloudy sky I feel colder.  </p><p>Once seeing the bright blue sky then I feel the weather is no longer cold, but cool. </p><p>I saw lots of signs along the road; it is difficult to understand the meaning.  </p><p>Does the number represent speed limit?  Then what does the tank in the sign means?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180616_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Some stone carving on the bridge, in Europe you can see art pieces anywhere.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180605_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Comparing to Poland, going toward southwest in Germany,</p><p>most of the places are farm fields, and the towns I meet are smaller in size, I have only gotten lost in one major city in Germany.  </p><p> </p><p>I finished al my food in the morning, right now I only have 2 small packages of candy in my bag, </p><p>I ate everything I can possibly eat this morning.  </p><p>Around 3pm, my stomach grumbled, it is no help eating candy,</p><p>so I better going to the grocery store to buy some food with substance. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180612_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is very easy to find grocery stores in Germany, almost as easy to find as gas stations. </p><p>Although there is a very weird rule, you cannot take pictures in the grocery store.  </p><p>Just because I took the above photo, there were 3 store clerks following me around until I left the store. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180614_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I purchased 2 loafs of toast here.  Right now I am hungry enough to finish a loaf of bread without any butter or jam,</p><p>slice after slice, until I am not hungry anymore.  </p><p> </p><p>There are few places I stops by now, such as the grocery store where I buy my food, and McDonald where I get water. </p><p>Finally there are the gas station, where I can usually find wireless Internet, and high likely chance to find electric plug-ins,</p><p>and my very new discovery, the air pump machine.  With the air pump machine, </p><p>I can now easily keep the tire in the fullest possible, this way it is easier to ride. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180628_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is very easy to use, put the piece in, and press on the “+” button, and look at the air pressure machine,</p><p>and wait until the tire pressure reaches 60.  </p><p> </p><p>While pumping air into the tire I can also charge batteries, resting here, no need to get gas just get air. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180630_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Other than not going into restaurants and hotels, there is also another change. </p><p>The clothing I am wearing go from light to thicker ones,</p><p>if I feel hot then I take the clothing off and put it on the bike, there is another sleeveless shirt inside.  </p><p> </p><p>Around 5pm in the afternoon, I will take off the shoes and socks, and ride with the slippers.  </p><p>This way I will allow the feet to air out for 3 hours, </p><p>so when I sleep in the nighttime I won’t sleep with stinky feet inside the tent. </p><p> </p><p>The shoes I took off I tie it on the bag in front of the bike. </p><p>If I tie the shoes on the back of the bike, then there is possibility the shoes will get lost while riding somewhere.  </p><p>Today is a very simple day, at least until now. </p><p>I didn’t leave until around noon, still living in Germany’s time zone, not much change.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180635_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Having a simple day is a good thing too, as long as there is no accident happening. </p><p>Having a great weather like this riding in such beautiful country is a pleasure.  </p><p> </p><p>Soon the sun will go down again, there is some problem though. </p><p>One thing is there is nothing to report for the travel journal, another is I didn’t ride very far today, just barely passed the 100km (62 miles) mark.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180641_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This way I will need to hurry up if I want to reach Paris by September 12 at noon, </p><p>unless the rest of the road are all flat and easy to ride.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, it would help if I stop getting lost, and don’t spend so much day light time writing the travel journals. </p><p>After eating the toast for a whole day combined with weird soda, I feel I don’t have enough calories. </p><p>I feel like I don’t have enough energy riding the bike, and before the store closed I went in to purchase 5 packs of chocolates.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180642_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The stores in Germany closes around 8pm every night, I have not seen a 24-hour store yet.  </p><p>After purchasing this pack of chocolate, I broke the amount I set up that I can spend today. </p><p>I will pretend I borrow money from tomorrow, since there is still a loaf of bread here,</p><p>and chocolates will add calories fast, it is a very important snack for riding the bike. </p><p> </p><p>After purchasing the chocolate, there are still 30 minutes left for me to ride the bike, </p><p>just 30km (19miles) less than my goal today, but I probably won’t reach it today. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180644_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the right side of the road is railroad track, and on the right of the track is a big river.  </p><p>On the right of the river is bike only lane, but I don’t know how to get there. </p><p> </p><p>During the day when I ride the bike, the car drivers will pass around me. </p><p>After the sun goes down, I will turn on the red flashlight, and turn on the bike headlights as well.  </p><p>I don’t know why, but after the sun goes down, the drivers like to honk their horn. </p><p>I know they are honking at me, are they warning me?  Or telling me not to ride on the streets in the dark? </p><p> </p><p>I do not feel good getting honked all the time, especially during the day I am respected.  </p><p>So I turn to Side Street, while there is some light out it is time to find a place to rest for tonight. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180645_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking at how I have camped the last few days, bus stop, empty house, bus stop again, followed by empty house again,</p><p>then I should find a bus stop to sleep for tonight.  </p><p>After turning into this small town I started looking for bus stops, but I only found bus stop markings, there is no “rest place”.  </p><p>However, it will not be good choice going back to the street to ride further.  </p><p>Right when I was wondering what to do, I saw a guy running on this cold evening.  </p><p>He stopped in front of me and breathed a big sigh. </p><p> </p><p>At first he started talking to me in German, then found I couldn’t understand so he talked to me in English.  </p><p>This is surprising since his English is great.  In European countries, only the young ones have excellent English. </p><p> </p><p>The older ones know several languages, but do not speak English.  </p><p>I told him I am traveling through on my bike, trying to find a place to rest tonight.  </p><p>Is there some type of park or bus stop around here?  </p><p> </p><p>He suggested a learning/activity center in this town, they provide housing, and it is cheap as well.  </p><p>He said he can ask for me, and maybe I can go there for free.  </p><p> </p><p>FREE?  I wasn’t expecting much, but the guy told me to follow him. </p><p>He was running ahead I followed behind with the bike.  </p><p>But I was still eyeing for another place to sleep tonight.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180647_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It took about 10 minutes to get there, and since he knows English we were able to chitchat. </p><p>I found out when he was younger he worked in an American military base.  </p><p>He also played lots of ping-pong with the soldiers, so his speaks English well.  </p><p>We kept talking but we forgot to tell each other our own names.  </p><p> </p><p>Peter, that is what he said his name is, not only is his English well, but his name is also very English. </p><p>Every time when someone asks me how many days I have been traveling?  </p><p>I answer 130+ days, the other person will show this unbelievable look;</p><p>really, I can’t believe I have been traveling so long either.  </p><p> </p><p>Running to the end of the street, it was a completely dark house, Peter looked at the sign outside saying the place is closed, </p><p>so there was no chance to ask if I can possibly get free lodging. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180648_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>So I asked the same question again, is there any place to camp?  </p><p>As long as I won’t get kicked out in the middle of the night.  </p><p>Peter say, follow him, he has a garage for me to sleep in.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180651_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Peter runs about 10km every night, because he needed to take me to the learning/activity center, so he runs extra today. </p><p>Peter seems really tired by now.  Turns out we passed by his home earlier, but he didn’t stop. </p><p>He still took me to the learning center, and now just came back.</p><p> </p><p>Peter went up to get the key, I waited by the garage downstairs, </p><p>it has gone completely dark already, and the temperature keeps dropping.  </p><p>When I was chatting with Peter earlier he said the temperature has been weird.  </p><p>Usually around this time of the year the temperature is still warm, but not sure what happened this year, </p><p>some places has already started snowing, and it was only September! </p><p> </p><p>This is Peter’s home.  It is great to live in Europe; you can purchase individual houses, </p><p>no need to live with strangers in the same building complex like a bird in a cage.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180652_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Three minutes later Peter came back and opened up the garage door, it is wonderful being able to sleep indoor tonight.  </p><p>This breaks the empty house and bus stop cycle.</p><p> </p><p>  In order for me to sleep comfortably, Peter even moved the car out, making a bigger space for me to sleep.  </p><p>Even though I kept saying, no need to trouble you, this is fine already.  </p><p>But Peter insisted the car wouldn’t complain spending the night outside is cold, so no need to be nice. </p><p> </p><p>After taking the bike in, I unloaded luggage and opened up the tent. </p><p>I told Peter I would leave first thing tomorrow; I will not trouble him.  </p><p>But Peter did not think I am any trouble, after I put the bike into the garage, </p><p>he asked me if I want anything to eat, how about some red wine?</p><p> </p><p>I opened up the plastic bag on the bike handle, took out an unopened bag of toast, I said I would eat this today,</p><p>I am grateful I can sleep in the garage tonight. </p><p>Peter looking at the toast and said leave this for tomorrow, and follow him upstairs for some warm food to eat. </p><p> </p><p>No need to trouble I said.  </p><p>No trouble from Peter.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180662_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Living with Peter is his wife, Ulrike, even with me the complete stranger, both welcome my visit.  </p><p>Sitting on the kitchen chair, Peter poured out a glass of red wine for me,</p><p>French wine, it is nice able to drink some wine to warm myself up in a cold night like this.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180654_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Ulrike used the oven to bake a pizza, and then took out a map. </p><p>Looking at this satellite map without country line, no place names, and no street, I found I have rode very far.  </p><p>Pointing to Taiwan, I said I live here, and then point to Beijing, I said I started here. </p><p>Then crossing Europe, I am almost at Paris. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180656_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Taking out the camera, playing the photos inside, I said I am lucky the tourist let me look at their map, </p><p>and letting me taking a picture of the map for reference, so I can ride all the way to here.  </p><p> </p><p>Then Peter took out a more detailed map of Germany, and then I started to study the route and taking picture. </p><p>It is very precious able to see a real map made with paper.  </p><p>After taking so many pictures, Peter said no trouble; he will give me this map. </p><p> </p><p>I can take this all the way to Paris and be fine. </p><p>Just like this I received a real map, detailed and free, the kind that is like a book, </p><p>not the kind you have to open up a big piece of paper, very easy to turn and not likely to torn.  </p><p> </p><p>After the pizza is done baking, it wasn’t placed on the kitchen table, but to the dining room table. </p><p>I already feel blessed having a warm pizza to eat, but the dining room table has even more stuff. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180667_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The whole pizza for me, and mozzarella cheese with tomato drizzled in extra virgin olive oil and basil;</p><p>I think this dish tastes great every time I eat it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180669_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And another type of cheese, with the addition of spices and minced onion, very delicious. </p><p>There are three types of cheese on the table, all are produce of France. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180673_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And there is preserved radish, with the addition of hot spices from Turkey.  The combination is great.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180675_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Glass after glass of red wine, sitting with Peter and Ulrike enjoying the wonderful meal.  </p><p>Fate is an interesting thing, meeting Peter during his run, </p><p>and then invited to his house for a full dinner, it is all beyond expectation. </p><p> </p><p>And 30 minutes ago I was still searching for a bus stop to sleep in the dark. </p><p>When I was eating I found I was missing one slipper.  Peter has a cat and a dog in the house.  </p><p>The dog likes to chew up stuff, the dog has already chewed up half dozen worth of shoes.  </p><p>Regardless how many chew toys or bones they purchase, the dog just likes to chew shoes, maybe because of smell. </p><p>In just one moment, the dog almost chewed the blue and white slipper up.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180699_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>After eating, Peter said he has something for me.  Then he took a foldable lounge chair going downstairs with me to the garage. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180681_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Peter said the floor is too cold; it will be more comfortable sleeping on the lounge chair. </p><p>I am so touched, and then I do not need to sleep on the hard and cold ground surface.  </p><p>There is light in the garage, and electric plug in as well, and then I can finish the travel journal before I sleep tonight. </p><p>Then tomorrow I have the whole day to ride the bike; hopefully I can ride up to 200km (124 miles).  </p><p>After pulling out the sleeping bag and ready to wrap myself in there to wrap the travel journal, </p><p>Peter asked me another thing, do you want to take a shower?  </p><p> </p><p>Shower?</p><p> </p><p>The last time for a shower was over a week ago. </p><p>And this week I have not even wiped myself with a towel because the weather is too cold, </p><p>I wouldn’t be able to take it wiping myself with a cold towel.</p><p> </p><p>I wanted to say yes, but I felt I would trouble them. </p><p>Just when I was saying no need to trouble, Peter said, no trouble.  </p><p>Then I took a towel, toothbrush, and toothpaste upstairs, thinking I will be happy able to wash myself with hot water.  </p><p>Peter said he hope I can take a bath, this way is easier for him. </p><p> </p><p>By just listening to him, I know he wanted me to take a relaxing bath, </p><p>but I know if I said no need to trouble just a shower will be fine, so I can’t decline once he said a bath is easier for him.  </p><p>Regardless how you think I know a bath is not easier than a shower, but Peter’s excuse is adorable and sweet. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180684_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I took the towel and the toothbrush to the bathroom, the tub was already filled with hot bubbly water.  </p><p>After a nice meal it is the priceless hot bubble bath. </p><p>I happily cleaned myself, and I had thought I wouldn’t have a chance to bath until I get to Paris. </p><p>I can’t believe this happened early.  </p><p>After cleaning up, I said good night to Peter and Ulrike whom were sitting in the living room watching TV,</p><p>I was ready to go downstairs to the garage to sleep.</p><p> </p><p> Then Peter rose up and said if I can sleep in a bedroom tonight, not he garage, it would not trouble him as much.  </p><p>This, me, I can’t even find an excuse to say no.  </p><p>Peter brought up the lounge chair from the garage upstairs,</p><p>and I followed behind him with my sleeping bag and the laptop.  </p><p> </p><p>The first room is a painting room, and there are even heater provided for warmth. </p><p>Outside in the dark is about 5 degrees Celsius (41F), but it is very warm in the bedroom. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180686_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I couldn’t believe my luck, someone nice brought me home, I got a map, ate a nice meal, </p><p>had a warm bath, and now sleeping in a warm house. </p><p> </p><p>Before I going to bed, Peter made a big pot of coffee; he is putting inside a thermo so I can take it with me for tomorrow.  </p><p>Since the coffee is hot right now, I drunk a big cup to kick away the sleepy bug. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180694_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But I need to finish the travel blog before going to bed tonight.  </p><p>Since I have been going to bed around 9pm the last few days, I do not have any power to stay up and fight off the sleepiness.  </p><p> </p><p>When I was drinking the coffee, I found a white envelope on the table. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180696_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>For Deray,</p><p>to be opened in Paris.  </p><p> </p><p>Even though I am very curious what is inside, but I will wait until I get to Paris before I open it.  </p><p>Peter, I caused you so much trouble, but you don’t think any of this is trouble,</p><p>today is to be remembered, and this is because I met a great German.</p><p><br /></p>
