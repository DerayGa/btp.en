										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-145_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">My body became stiff from staying the whole night in the little log cabin.  </span></p><p>However, during the whole night it didn’t rain, but all the stuff that was left outside the log cabin is now covered with the morning dew.  </p><p>There is probably something wrong with my watch.  When the watch shows it is not going to rain, it will rain.  </p><p>And when the watch shows it will rain, and then it might rain, sometimes even 3 days later.  </p><p>When I got up this morning the weather was pretty good, I can still see the pretty sunrise. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190043_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I went to the water pump I found yesterday and used the near frozen water to wipe my face.  </p><p>My hand became numb when I got the towel wet with the cold water.  </p><p>Using the frozen cold water to rub my face a bit, and now my whole face became numb as well.  Just like this, I am awake.  </p><p>This is the second day in France, so lets continue to ride. </p><p> </p><p>I still didn’t ride to 150km yesterday, and I entered from Germany, so I actually rode less than what I had planned.  </p><p>So today I need to work hard and make up for yesterday.  </p><p> </p><p>This is the park where I slept yesterday, a few long benches, some toddler duck chairs and the cabin I slept in. </p><p>I had already packed up the sleeping bag, but the heavy shirt I used to wrap up my head is still on the table.  </p><p>Good thing I used the heavy clothing to wrap up my head, or I would get sick from sleeping outdoor in such cold night. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190042_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So how cold was it exactly?  </p><p>Since I already got up, then I can find out.  It is almost 8am, the sun has already got up, </p><p>but the temperature is about 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).  And everywhere is covered with the morning dew</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190047_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So how cold was it last night, this will always be a mystery.  </p><p>I don’t want to know either, since this will only make me feel colder.  </p><p>I had thought after entering France, the cold weather will not be as harsh.  </p><p>But it looks like both France and Germany got weird weather.  People can probably ski on the Alps by now. </p><p>After tonight, then I am pretty sure the next few days I cannot camp outside, or there is possibility to freeze to death.  </p><p> </p><p>Rubbing my shaking hands against each other, and then looking down at the tire that has lost all its air.  </p><p>Just like this, no more air in it at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190039_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I don’t want to stop to pump air into the tire today, so I should spend time this morning changing a new inner tube, </p><p>this way I can carry on a happy feeling while riding.  </p><p>Even if I am not happy while riding, but at least I won’t get discouraged because of broken inner tube.</p><p> </p><p> This time I finally found the cause of the flat tire.  I couldn’t tell from the inner tube, </p><p>but I found the scratch on the outer tire.  Using a tweezers I picked out a small piece of glass.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190045_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just this tiny thing, this used up another inner tube.  </p><p>However, think on the good side, at least I found the cause of the flat tire, so the bike should ride better today, right? </p><p> </p><p>However, this is just my wish, not based on any real facts.  </p><p>The watch shows it will rain today, but I actually bike against the wind all day.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190049_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I started riding at 8am, and continued until 9pm.  I didn’t stop to rest today, </p><p>and the average speed was about 13km/hour (8.08mile/hour), very very slow.  </p><p> </p><p>How much I can ride in a day depends on the average speed.  </p><p>Normally I can ride 15km/hour, but I try to keep it at 18km/hour. </p><p>In rough estimation, if I ride 10 hours, then with 18km/hour I can ride about 180km/day (112miles/day), </p><p>this is 50km (31 miles) more than riding at 13km/hour. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190057_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is huge difference.  Even though I rode 10 hours, but it isn’t as easy, the only difference is the total distance I rode is less.</p><p> </p><p>There are few reasons for riding slower, uphill and against the wind.  </p><p>It is ok with uphill, because there is bound to be downhill, so overall is ok.  But riding against the wind has no advantage at all.  </p><p>Looking at the flat road, but I need to use the same energy I use for riding up the hill, I do not feel happy about it at all. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190060_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>“Plat du Jour” on this sign means the special of the day.  </p><p>However, after ordering I cannot guess what I would get, just whatever the chef decides to prepare.  </p><p>Sometimes this also mean self-serve, there are a few dishes that are all you can eat style, about $10 Euro ($15USD), </p><p>it isn’t cheap at all.  But compared to local living standards, this is the normal cost. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190052_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I continue to eat my toast; the French ones are more expensive.  </p><p>The same 750gram toast cost $0.69 Euro in Germany, but sells for $1.05 Euro ($1.58USD) in France. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190054_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Other than toast, I cannot find anything else that will fill my stomach, this is the only thing that is cheap and will fill my stomach. </p><p>I also got a package of fruit candy.  After getting these 2 things, I just have $0.63 Euro ($0.94 USD) left, </p><p>not even a whole $1 Euro.  I am so poor, poor to the point to be cry about it.</p><p> </p><p>After finishing this loaf of bread, I am not sure what I am going to eat for tomorrow and the day after.  </p><p> </p><p>Today the whole day I did not find a place where I can exchange currency.  </p><p>The ad on the side of the road, this probably means by recycling every 4-spray bottle, </p><p>there will be 1kg less of carbon dioxide released. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190059_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And carbon dioxide is the cause of global warming, so everyone needs to keep recycling on his or her mind.  </p><p>Just like Germany, when you purchase your soda in plastic bottle, they will charge you extra for the recycling automatically.  </p><p>The price they charge you for the plastic bottle recycling are almost as expensive as soda,</p><p>this way everyone will recycle those things that can be used again.  </p><p> </p><p>After entering France, I couldn’t see the store charging for recycling the bottle.  </p><p>In France they only have posters up, but in Germany they are enforcing recycling, very different.  </p><p>The whole day is like this weather; some small rain will come down.  </p><p>This road looks flat, but because I am riding against the wind, it is very difficult to ride.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190064_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The cloud on the sky is very pretty; the changing shapes looks like some artist made it.</p><p> </p><p> Because the houses will block wind from blowing on me, so once I enter a town it will be easier to ride. </p><p>From here I can see something really tall in the distance, something like a castle.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190071_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I could see the tall building from the front, so this is probably a church.  </p><p>But I don’t feel like touring it right now, probably because I have rode against the wind, </p><p>so the whole day I couldn’t ride very fast at all.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190080_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In my mind when I am in France, whenever passing a town, there is a beautiful river flowing through, almost always.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190078_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The front entrance with lots of flags hanging is usually city office.  </p><p>Some are big and some are small, at this point, I don’t know how city offices can help me. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190087_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Asking for direction or borrowing maps, I go to the tourist center.  </p><p>The Internet is available everywhere.  Getting water and electricity, I go to the gas station. </p><p>But I didn’t discover gas stations today; this is ridiculous, even gas stations are becoming rare.  </p><p>So I have no water today, I am very thirsty, and feeling down. </p><p> </p><p>The towns I had passed through earlier I didn’t try to get water there, so now I am in trouble.  </p><p>Eating toast while hungry, but too thirsty so I can’t swallow the toast. </p><p> </p><p>How come the last leg of the road in France is so hard to ride?  </p><p>The weather is so cold, and I had thought I would freeze to death last night.  </p><p>The wind is working against me, every time I want to ride more I ended up riding even less.  </p><p>Afterwards I saw a car repair shop, so I went and asked if they can let me have some water.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190090_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The auto mechanic said sure, and took me to their bathroom. </p><p>In France, I can drink the water from the tap, so I can drink however much I would like. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190089_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So I filled 2 bottles with water, approximately 1.5L, and took them on the road. </p><p>I should be able to last all day today with the 2 water bottles. </p><p>It is weird, I was sad earlier, but now after I drink some water, I feel better. </p><p>Actually the situation isn’t that bad, even though I ride slow, but at least I am moving. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190094_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And to think on the positive side, even though it is cold, but at least it isn’t raining.</p><p> </p><p>Just when I was thinking about this, it started raining.  </p><p>The watch showed it will rain for so many days, and now it really started raining. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190097_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In this cold weather, I am wondering whatever landed on me is rain or snow, maybe sleet?</p><p> </p><p>The air covering in fog after it had rained, it looks like some sort of light gauze covering the mountaintop.  </p><p>I was riding against the wind earlier on the road you see below, and now I have started riding uphill.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190099_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In just short time, the cloud-covered sky now shows some blue in it.  </p><p>So above this heavy cloud there is a beautiful weather.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190101_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If I am taking a plane and go upward, pass those heavy clouds, then I can probably see lots of bright sunny weather.  </p><p>Looking down is the ground covered with rain and clouds.  In weather like this when will it get sunny again? </p><p> </p><p>Today the sunset came early too, and the whole day other than riding the bike I didn’t do anything else.  </p><p>But I didn’t get very far, even though I had wanted to ride extra to make up yesterday’s portion, </p><p>but I didn’t even ride today’s quota either.  </p><p>The sunset is very pretty, the reddish-orange sunlight colored the clouds; it looks like the whole forest is on fire</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190107_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am disregarding this is cars only road, I need to get up this mountaintop, so I can view this before the sun goes down.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190109_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The marking on the cars only path says A2500m, so I had thought cars only path will only last 2500m, but it wasn’t so.  </p><p>I am disregarding those cars only path right now, I need to get up to the mountaintop, </p><p>and record the image right before the sun goes down.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190116_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Then I am wondering if my picture taking skill is very bad, or the camera cannot record what I see in nature.  </p><p>The view I saw on the mountaintop is very different from the picture; </p><p>the shock value from the real beautiful scenery is very different.  </p><p> </p><p>Standing on top of the mountaintop, I can easily see every moment of the sunset.  </p><p>The clouds are flowing past fast because of the wind, and everything is moving like it has life. </p><p>  </p><p>Other than enjoying good food in the trip, </p><p>I feel I am rewarded the most from seeing natural views like this, every sunrise and sunset, </p><p>each one is different, each requires to experience it with the heart.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190120_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The wind powered machine is seen everywhere in France, and they also flash with light.  </p><p>Even though it is neat to see them turn and turn, but this also means the wind blows very heavy here.  </p><p>Riding through with the bike is very difficult.  The sun is almost disappearing; the clouds are constantly ever changing.  </p><p>The plane that flew by left a streak of clouds behind it, it is like putting some marking for this view. </p><p> </p><p>After riding through this cars only path, what lies ahead for me is cars only path again.  </p><p>However, I need to get past this in order to continue my trip, otherwise I will just stuck here. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190123_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The corn field on the side of the road, even though the road condition isn’t very good, but it is rideable. </p><p>I continue to ride in the little path on the side of the road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190124_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The little path ends and meet up with the big road, </p><p>this is the intersection of some big road, lots of signs prohibiting me to pass by, so I ended up riding along the exit.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190125_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I couldn’t find where I am from the map, this road is not seen from the map either, </p><p>so I need to find where I am and continues to ride toward a city. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190128_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had not planned to ride through St. Dizier, but since I had no choice, whatever I can ride I will ride.  </p><p>I am afraid when I have nowhere to ride, then it will be pitiful. </p><p> </p><p>Before 9pm the city is in dark again, of course it gets dark in the evening, but to me it is like a curse.  </p><p>Because when curse starts, then I cannot ride anymore.  Besides, the temperature will continue to go down, faster than park slides.  </p><p>During the day the temperature is about 15C (59F), but in the evening it is around 10C (50F), and continue to drop.  </p><p> </p><p>The previous night I spent it in the mini log cabin.  </p><p>Even though there is roof covering, but if it really did rain, I wonder how good of a shield would it be.  </p><p>So I must find a decent place to sleep tonight, if there is a hotel here that accepts credit card, </p><p>then I wouldn’t be able to resist, swiping my credit card for a nice room.</p><p> </p><p>But I had already predicted what would happen after, </p><p>I would spend the whole night writing the travel journal, and just few hours of sleep, </p><p>in order to ride more I would leave very early in the morning.  </p><p>Spending lots of money for lodging, but not really enjoying it, </p><p>so I better find an empty place to spend the night, I would probably sleep better anyway. </p><p> </p><p> I didn’t find a hotel, or an empty house, but I did find a huge storage shed outside of the town.  </p><p>It is very clean inside, but dust is not avoidable.  However, in cleanness like this, it means someone do use it.  </p><p>The doors of the storage shed are about 2 floors high, and it isn’t closed, so I just enter without asking. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190132_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After entering if found a small corner to spend the night.  Even if someone passes by, I am not noticeable from the outside. </p><p>If someone does come inside, then I will explain whom I am.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190135_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Using the flashlight to show my way, there is enough room to sleep inside.  </p><p>I took out all my camping gear, there is roof covering tonight so I can sleep well. </p><p>If it does rain, then I wouldn’t need to worry about getting wet, and getting stiff and numb from the cold. </p><p> </p><p>When I got in the sleeping bag it felt like a cold bath.  </p><p>Because it had just rained, the sleeping bag and the clothing on me has some light moisture on it, so it is quite cold.  </p><p>Use my body slowly warm things up, and the sleeping bag keeps the warmth in.  </p><p>After I got warm, I slowly became sleepy.  Without any resistance, I entered my dream. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless how cold it was during the night, as long as I can open my eyes in the morning, then it will be a brand new day.   </p><p><br
