blowing on me, since I didn’t change so I used the sleeping bag to cover up myself.  </span></p><p>But once I leave the sleeping bag I don’t have any extra clothing to put on.  </p><p>In the dark night with the freezing wind blowing directly to my spine, </p><p>the bike handle is covered with the frozen morning dew; it felt so cold holding it.  </p><p>The water in the water bottle is very precious, but I still pour some out on a towel, and use the towel to wipe my face.  </p><p>This counts as another shower.</p><p> </p><p>In the star covered sky, I stand on the hard ground and felt like the ground is moving.  </p><p>My body keep leaning to the back, just like I am drunk, can’t stand straight.  </p><p>Wasn’t just one night no sleep to write the travel journal?  Is the side effect this serious?  </p><p>In a moment I will have to ride on the road, this will be ok, right? </p><p>I am not able to stand straight, but this doesn’t mean I can’t ride the bike. </p><p>I only have to step on the pedals to ride the bike.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190219_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the pitch-black night, I can’t see anything; I don’t know where the moon has gone.  </p><p>If I need the star to guide me, then I will need to find a pair of night goggles. </p><p>I can see things once awhile when cars passing by me.  </p><p>Sometimes the cars driving against me passes by from the front, the harsh headlights makes my eyes feel like it is going blind.  </p><p>Other than the cars passing by guiding me, I am depending on the bike.  </p><p>Since there is barely any light, I took out the flashlight to guide my way.</p><p> </p><p>fter sleeping in bus stops so many times, and listening to cars driving past by, </p><p>now I know the least number of cars on the road is between 3-6AM.  </p><p>Leaving at 4am I need to be careful, not to ride into a gravel pit or a hole, otherwise it should be safe.  </p><p>I believe a car will not hit me; </p><p>this is because even though the only thing showing my existence is a little flashing red light, but it works very well.</p><p> </p><p>A  I can hear from far away a car is coming, </p><p>and usually I can guess if it is a truck or a small car, then the cars will shine on me with their high beam light, </p><p>slow down, pass by me from far away, and then speed up and drive away.  </p><p>But if there happens to be another car blocking and the car can’t pass by me, </p><p>the driver will patiently drive slowly behind, and will pass me at the appropriate time. </p><p> </p><p>Every time a car passes by me, I will say to myself, they can’t hit me,</p><p>it will be fine, they can’t hit me, relax, they can’t hit me, don’t be afraid.  </p><p>However the thing I am afraid the most is falling down.  </p><p>Even if the cars behind me will try to avoid me, but I still try too ride toward edge.  </p><p>Of course when I do, there is the possibility of riding on gravel and sandy road surface. </p><p>In the pitch dark night my sight level is not very clear, when something appears in my lighted area,</p><p>I only have one second to figure out what it is, and if I need to avoid it.</p><p> </p><p> I feel thirsty, but drinking water has no use, this is because riding in the dark makes me feel nervous, the thirstiness is caused by the stress. </p><p> </p><p>In the night I see the animals such as squirrel, skunk, etc flattened by the car, </p><p>and the road surface reflect the reddish blood and skin, it looks 10 time more scary than during the day. </p><p>I kept pushing the light on my watch to find out what time it is.  </p><p>But the more I check the time the slower the time passes by.  </p><p>I had thought there would be light by 6am, but it wasn’t so. </p><p>Finally at around 6:30am, the far away horizon finally has some sunlight, I made it to daylight. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190225_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Every time when I see sunrise, I will tell myself where the sun is coming up is my home, it is not far away at all,</p><p>just on the other side of the horizon.  </p><p>And every time I see the sunset, regardless where I am at,</p><p>I will tell myself where the sun is going down is my destination, just a hand touch away, almost there.</p><p> </p><p>In the dark night combined with a little light, right now I am in the middle of darkness and sunlight. </p><p>It is very amazing feeling being in a huge field feeling the night and day changes.  </p><p>Before the sun came up, the sky has lots of beautiful colored clouds;</p><p>it looks like ribbons sitting in the sky.  The clouds are covered by the sunlight colors.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190235_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I am trying to ride as much as I can, I still stopped and stood by the bike to enjoy this beautiful scenery.</p><p>I didn’t sleep all night but I got this beautiful sunrise.  </p><p> </p><p>Of course riding in the night I can’t be wearing sunglasses, this is like riding blind.  </p><p>So I changed to my normal glasses, putting the sunglasses on top of the bag. </p><p>I had put the sunglasses on top of the bag before and never saw it drop.  </p><p>When the sun came up it is after 7am already.  It is today, before the sun gets to the top, I have to get to Paris.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190240_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Just when I am about changing to the sunglasses to ride, since wearing glasses I look dorky, </p><p>I realized I don’t know where the sunglasses went?! </p><p> </p><p>My goodness, the same style sunglasses I have lost 2 of them. </p><p>I don’t know where the sunglasses fell off during the shaky ride, and to go back is impossible.  </p><p>I can’t get the sunglasses back even with how sorry I am, so I ended up wearing the normal glasses to ride.  </p><p> </p><p>When the sun came up, I finished riding the N4 section that allows bike.  </p><p>After this N4 will become cars only path again, but this also means Paris is near.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190243_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Turning into D231 road going toward the sign that points to Paris.  </p><p>The fastest way to Paris is A4, but it is a freeway and bike isn’t allowed.  </p><p>So I will have to go around and try to get into Paris.  </p><p> </p><p>Paris is a big city, with lots of parks surrounds the city.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/map2_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="458" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two years ago when I rode from the southeast, </p><p>just riding to the city center got me frustrated, the whole path is very complicated.  </p><p> </p><p>At the time regardless how I try I couldn’t into the city, </p><p>I ended up having to ride on the A4 freeway to get to the destination, but I don’t want to do that again.  </p><p>This time I am riding from the east toward Paris, following the sign says Paris,</p><p>seeing it changing to freeway I know I am near Paris. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190246_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Start riding at 4am, I got to the outskirts of Paris around 9am, the speed is surprising.  </p><p>Seeing a river that I thought is the Seine River, seeing houses I thought it is the Louvre Museum, </p><p>but I have no idea where I am, and it felt like I am toward my final destination.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190244_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>After getting into the city, the map is not useful anymore, </p><p>turning left and right trying to avoid the streets that don’t allow bikes, but those are also the fastest way going to Paris. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190252_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Two years ago when I was under the same situation I felt pitiful, the motorcycles can go, but why not bicycles?  </p><p>So back then I got onto A4 freeway, it would be hard to believe I can’t get to Paris without riding on bicycle allowed path. </p><p> </p><p>Looking at the direction the freeway is going, and then I try to find substitute path going toward similar direction, </p><p>passing one area after another, and going toward the city center.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190253_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>And seeing the river again, this isn’t the Seine River, so just following the riverside I can’t get to my destination either.  </p><p>I am glad this time I brought the compass; I don’t know how I can get into the city without it. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190256_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Feeling I am going toward the right direction, but there is no way to prove it.  </p><p>So when I see someone I will take the map over and go ask direction.  </p><p>There are lots of tourists in Paris, anywhere you can see tourist looking for direction with a map in hand. </p><p>Just like this guy, he is holding a map of Paris. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190261_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is very useful, one can buy this at the newspaper stand for $10 Euro ($15USD), </p><p>but I don’t have this kind of money to spend right now.  </p><p>The pink area the guy is pointing to is the city center, this is not far away,</p><p>if I just ride a little bit to the west, and follow the Seine River. </p><p> </p><p>Also, when I asked this guy where the Eiffel Tower is, he told me it is very far from here, some more KM of road. </p><p>I assured him, it isn’t far, not far at all.</p><p> </p><p>  Thanks to the guy, I arrived at Paris.  On this trip every time I get into a big city I will stop by the city sign and take a picture. </p><p><span data-img-src="../../_Media/p1190268_med.jpeg"

											</span></p><p>This photo has the most meaning, the destination Paris, I rode over 100kms with my blue and white slipper to get here.  </p><p>Since I lost my sunglasses, now I have to show my real face for the photo.  </p><p>Because I didn’t sleep all night, my face isn’t very shining; </p><p>it is covered with some excitement and tiredness, just like someone who is working hard.  </p><p>One is pushing me down and the other one is making me stepping on the pedal every time.</p><p> </p><p>First riding 170 some km, and then sit in a gas station to rest for 6 hours. </p><p>I didn’t waste that time and I sit in the cold to write travel journal, finally rode more than 100km.  </p><p>I still feel shaky, but when I ride the bike I can still sort of keep my balance. </p><p>I feel shaky too if I sit on the bike but feet on the ground, I can’t feel balance anymore. </p><p>It feels like there is gravity from all side,</p><p>so when I am not careful I will fall to the ground with the bike, riding with no speed and fall to the ground.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Since my body can’t take it anymore, then I might as well take what I got and get to my final destination. </p><p>This river is the real Seine River.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190273_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Getting into Paris, I found a packed bridge to cross the river, and then follow the river going west. </p><p>Dreaming the last left of the travel for a while, I am almost there. </p><p> </p><p>There are lots of vendors next to the river that sells everything.  </p><p>I am not familiar with Paris, except the trip 2 years ago.  </p><p>Because I was riding the bike then, I didn’t go inside a lot of places.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190277_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The bike lane inside the city has better condition, compared to the countryside; this is like the heaven of the bike lanes</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190282_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Comparing to Taiwan, those big cities don’t use traffic as an excuse; </p><p>cities like Paris, Moscow, Beijing, and Warsaw all have excellent bike lanes.  </p><p>Those cities can do it why not Taipei?  How about Taiwan?  </p><p>Please respect bike riders, not just fine people for what they are not suppose to do, </p><p>things such as enforcing helmet wear and licensing bicycles just limit bicycle riders, </p><p>those rules do not help them.  Those are just horrible rules that were made.</p><p> </p><p>Any city mayor, especially Taiwan, if they are willing to ride the bicycle to look around, </p><p>they would realize it is very difficult to ride the bicycle in the city.  </p><p>No bicycle lanes, no decent planning, this just shows bicycles are not allowed in the city.  </p><p>So if people want to ride their bicycle they would have to go to the countryside.  </p><p>If one of those days when I can ride bicycle in Taipei like the way I ride in Paris, </p><p>that kind of easiness, respected, safety, then I would say Taipei is a first rate city as well.</p><p> </p><p>Paris is currently pushing for public bicycle move, the other cities in France has been doing it for a while now. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190357_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Brand new bicycles line the street; this is the healthy and environmental public transportation mode.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190377_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I admire some of the rules in Europe, such as having high gas price.  </p><p>It would be better if it is more expensive, then everyone will have less chance to be on the road. </p><p>The expensive gas actually includes lots or fees, such as environmental cleaning fee, </p><p>in theory they should use those fees to pay some of the public transportation cost.  </p><p>This way, one can take the bus, electric car, or MRT when traveling.  </p><p>Of course able to ride the bicycle is even more comfortable and easy going.</p><p> </p><p> Imagine, if the MRT in Taipei is like Moscow, the same price regardless how far, all for just $15NT (US0.50USD), </p><p>then how many people would be willing to take the MRT and not drive.  </p><p>Don’t say it is not possible, or the MRT is complicated, the MRT in Moscow is bigger than the one in Taipei County can do this, </p><p>why cannot Taipei? </p><p> </p><p>In Paris, in more crowded road, </p><p>the bicycle and bus lane are together, in majority of the road the bicycle has their own path to ride on.  </p><p>This is not only just on the weekends, but in Paris if you ride your bicycle anywhere anytime. </p><p> </p><p>In Taipei, with so many traffic rules, </p><p>if Taipei can manage their bicycle rules just like Hong Kong or Paris, I can only say, go for it. </p><p>I wish those high political office people can step out and enjoy riding the bicycle in the area they govern in,</p><p>experience the same needs as the people who live in those city.  </p><p>Do you want the people riding the bicycle be getting tickets or smiling? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190280_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Following the riverbank, very soon I saw the very tall Eiffel Tower in the distance, going towards the tower!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190284_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The more I go forward the more the tower is closer to me, </p><p>everyone can imagine music in the background, to see what kind of music is playing.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190286_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The final destination, the Eiffel Tower. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190294_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>The GPS map, the blue is the path I took. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/map-3_med_hr-2.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="574" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>There is a ball game in Paris right now; lots of guys dressed in skirts celebration their own country’s games.  </p><p>Even if there are no events, I think regardless what time I come here; it will always be this festive.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190301_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I got to the Eiffel Tower, there is no one to welcome me, no reporter asking questions, </p><p>no white line designated the finish line, but this is the finish I want. </p><p> </p><p>Lots of tourist, lots of conversation, </p><p>no one saw a dirty young man riding a bike hanging with luggage and spare tires quietly arrived at the Tower.  </p><p>With my tired body, I rode here.  I left on April 23, 2007 at 6:50am in the morning; </p><p>Mario from the cheap motel took a picture of me then.  </p><p>The brand new bike, clean cloth, and me not knowing how the trip would turn out, started here, 144 days of traveling. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1000343_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="599" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span></p><p>After 14000+km road (8700 miles), almost 5 months, the bike is now dirty, </p><p>everything that can broke has broke once, lost lots of luggage, I got darker from the sun, </p><p>my body has lots of scars, although I am not sure if I got fatter or skinnier, but one thing I do know,</p><p>I am dirty, each day dirtier than the other.  Dusting off myself, it is ok to get dirty, I don’t care. </p><p>As long as I have a breath left in me, just with this breath, anything I want to do is possible.</p><p> </p><p>Taking out the flag from the bag, time for flying.  </p><p>Putting the camera on the ground, taking the flag next to the bike, </p><p>the people passing by all stopped and looked at me with a curious look on their face. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190341_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="1600" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The bike leaning against the fence, all around the tourist are chatting, I can clearly hear my heart beat.  </p><p>God, if I will die from exhaustion, then let me take this picture first.  </p><p>Click, the sound of the camera, this moment is now captured.  </p><p>Time, September 12, 2007, 1:55pm.</p><p> </p><p> The previous travel journals of Taiwan and France, people have noticed the last entry I write hastily.  </p><p>Because this is just part of a trip, this doesn’t mean the world stops, life is long, there will be lots more exciting trips waiting for me.  </p><p>So after two years circling Taiwan I went on a trip circling France, after 2 years I rode from Beijing to Paris.  </p><p>So now where should I go?</p><p> </p><p>Right now there is only one place I want to be.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Right now I want to go home. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After taking the picture, it is done.  It feels good this is it, I have been dizzy for a while, and finally I can sit and rest.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190297_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After I sit down it felt I can go to sleep anytime, </p><p>but right now there is something I must do, I can finally open the envelope from Peter.  </p><p>There is a small note inside with $50 Euro ($75USD), this is not small amount, about $2000NT. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190299_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking at the money inside, if I knew it was money, and then I wouldn’t have took it;</p><p>I would pretend forgetting about it on the table. </p><p>I already spent the night at Peter’s home, a nice meal and a bath, this already a lot, how can I take this money. </p><p> </p><p>I guess Peter knew I wouldn’t have accepted it, </p><p>so he wrote on the envelope only open after arriving in Paris, so even if I want to give it back, </p><p>there is no way I could.  </p><p>Holding this money, I went to eat a nice meal with salad, BBQ meat, fries and bread in a sidewalk café.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190385_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After eating so many days of toast, now eating this full meal, my mouth chewing, then my tears started falling down. </p><p>The boss said is the hot sauce too hot?  The whole atmosphere is not the same now. </p><p> </p><p>In this trip, I owe lots to the countries I passed by, and the people who are on this land too much.  </p><p>I can’t give back all, every time changing to a new country; I use the local dialect to say thanks.  </p><p><br /></p><p>Every day, I am thankful of everyone’s help and cheer.  </p><p>Every moment, I am glad I still have energy continue to ride.  </p><p>Every minute I always remember there are lots of people expecting me arriving to Paris.  </p><p>Every second I tried to breathe to prove I did live my life to the fullest.  </p><p><br /></p><p>I want to thank those countries, they give me food when I am hungry, letting me a place to sleep in cold nights, </p><p>and a warm hands helping me when I need it.  I am not the best, the people I meet on this trip are. </p><p> </p><p>I didn’t finish this trip on my own; I really did finish 14000+km on this trip, on a bicycle.  </p><p>The bike didn’t require any gas, but it required lots of pumps for the tire.  Lots of inner tubes and tires were broken on this trip.  </p><p> </p><p>In this trip I don’t feel lonely because there is a partner with me, sharing every moment with me.  </p><p>In the cold night when I am inside the tent, looking at the bike, I sadly say today you will have to experience the coldness again. </p><p> </p><p>When it rains, tire blew, or when I break something, I will apologize to the bike saying I am sorry for putting you in this position.  </p><p>When fixing the bike, I would sing and say, don’t worry, when I finish fixing you, we will continue to ride the rest of the trip. </p><p> </p><p>Lots of people told me to toss away the broken tires, riding with broken tire, other than being very heavy, what is the point?  </p><p>Of course they have meaning, they are part of the bike, how can I toss them on the side of the road.</p><p> </p><p>Dido, is not like a boat where it talks; it endures the bad road and weather condition silently.  </p><p>I am lucky, I can sit on you and ride all the way from Beijing to Paris.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190350_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Dido, if you can say something, what would you want to say?</p><p> </p><p>Looking at you from sitting on the ground, I just starred at you. </p><p>Lots of people say I can ride so far, but I am not a hero, because I am not the one that is tired, anyone can ride this.  </p><p>So any compliments toward me you should proudly receive them, because you are excellent.</p><p> </p><p>So for people who do not know who I am, no need to remember who I am either. </p><p>Just remember, in 2007, a bicycle crossed Asia to Europe, finished a trip a car took over 100 years ago. </p><p>What is the point for this trip?  I don’t want to argue, I just want to let everyone know there are too many cars,</p><p>and the exhaust gas from the car is about to destroy the earth.</p><p> </p><p>A 100 years after now when you and I are not here, what will we leave behind?  </p><p>I hope in future time, there will be people still hearing about this trip, and hearing people’s laugh from riding bicycles.  </p><p> </p><p>The End </p><p> </p>
