										<div><p><img src="../../_Media/logo-146_hr.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="180" class="first" /></p><p class="style5"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Indoor temperature is definitely better, when I woke up this morning; the temperature is around 10C (50F).  </span></p><p>Looking at the temperature I feel better inside, this is better than temperature at single digit.  </p><p>I had felt if I sleep here, people might come in early to work, so I set the alarm up at 6am to wake myself up. </p><p>I am hoping to leave here early without any noticing me, but the alarm froze so it didn’t ring so I slept until 7am in the morning.  </p><p> </p><p>When I woke up I quickly packed up the camping gear, I was afraid I would be discovered.  </p><p>Good thing when I left everything was ok, and the temperature outside was fine too.  </p><p>The clouds is still dark and dreary, the frozen fingers need some exercise before they would move.  </p><p> </p><p>After I left I remembered why I rode here, it was because of those cars only path.  </p><p>Those cars only path would still be there, they wouldn’t disappear just after my sleep, so I need to figure out a way to ride on the cars only path.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190137_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The path I need to take clearly has cars only signs posted.  Of course I can choose to ride on it regardless, </p><p>but the end results are either stopped by a cop, cars honking at me, or worst scenario is a car accident.  </p><p>The substitute path is the country lane on the right side, but the country lane condition isn’t very good. </p><p>However, I have no choice, there are no other road I can take, and no bicycle lanes only either.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190139_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Initially, the country lane follows right along the cars only path, </p><p>just the road condition is not as good, but at least the direction is the same.  </p><p>But I don’t understand when the cars only path is flat and straight, but the country path has various hills?  </p><p> </p><p>Drivers in France is not like drivers in Kazakhstan, whom leaves the car light on all day.  </p><p>The drivers in France only turns light on at night and early morning, so when I see cars after cars with lights on, I felt it is a little too early. </p><p>Today I didn’t get to view the sunrise since the clouds is still very thick.  </p><p>However, the wind isn’t blowing against me as hard today, the wind level has decreased.</p><p> </p><p> After riding on the country path for a while I need to cross to the other side on the over-pass bridge.  </p><p>Looking from the top, it is easy to see why this road is cars only, it is not because of fast car speed or heavy traffic, </p><p>but the reason is because there is no place for bikes, not even a small shoulder area,</p><p>both lanes of traffic covers up the road completely.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190140_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If bicycle is riding on the cars only road, then all the cars will have to change lanes to avoid the biker, </p><p>and this can easily result in car accidents.  </p><p>Thus the road in France isn’t planned well, this is a nightmare for bikers.  </p><p>I had this experience in the past when I traveled through France, and now it is all over again. </p><p> </p><p>Riding on the country lane I see some area that had once paved with asphalt. </p><p>However, riding here I can not see any street sign, no name at all, and no idea where those country path will lead me</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190141_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I wouldn’t be too surprised if when I reach the end it is a pasture of cornfields, </p><p>this is because this is not a real road, I need to be prepared to go back anytime. </p><p> </p><p>I plan the worse, but the ending is still hopeful.  After passing by fields and the forest, I see signs of houses in the front.  </p><p>This means I can get on normal road to ride again. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190142_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is a moment to be remembered, this is the first sign I see in France showing Paris, but it doesn’t have any distance showing.  </p><p>In my estimation, I still have 300km (187 miles) to go.  </p><p>I should arrive at Paris tomorrow, however it might be difficult arriving there before noon.  </p><p>From what I have been riding the last few days, I will probably arrive there around sun down.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190145_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>While trying to get to Paris, some pictures for you of France’s countryside.  </p><p>Looking at those duck, I feel sorry for them, the lake water must be very cold.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190148_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Good thing I came across this town while riding so I am not totally lost. </p><p>So maybe by taking small country path like this, I might be on the way to Paris. </p><p>After I left this town, the path here is again for cars only, so I took the little country road alongside the cars only path again.  </p><p>Riding on the little path without any car accompanying me is a bit lonely.  </p><p>Listening to the sound of cars passing by I can make sure I am riding along the correct way, </p><p>otherwise I am afraid I will get lost again.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190150_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After going around the forest I can see the cars only path underneath, I want to ride legally on the cars only path, </p><p>the easiest, shortest road, but it is a road that doesn’t allow me to be on it.  </p><p>Following the big road, sometimes turning left, sometimes turning right, </p><p>then I got onto a road I do not know, and surrounded by mountains.  </p><p> </p><p>As long as I am in crossroads, there will be signs of current location and where it is going.  </p><p>This is one good thing about France, however, those street and location can not be found on maps. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190152_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Every time meeting a crossroadI will stop and get out the map, </p><p>and look for the location and street that cannot be found on the map.  </p><p>Then I will pick a direction to ride although I am not sure where I am going.  </p><p>While riding, I would think, would I pick the wrong one?  Maybe the other one is the correct path, do I need to go back. </p><p>I will ride like this the rest of the way.</p><p> </p><p>When I get lost too much I would want to ask other people for direction.  </p><p>Sometimes there are cars passing by, but no one wants to stop.  </p><p>Today is already Monday, but when I passed by towns today, most of the places are still closed.  </p><p>Finally passing by a farmhouse I see people chatting outside, so I run over with my map to ask for directions.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190159_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I don’t care if there is language barrier, I point to the map saying I want to get to Paris, which road should I take?  </p><p>The other person cannot find where I am currently on the map, just some close by locations. </p><p>The good man took over my notebook started writing down all the towns I will pass by from now on, </p><p>so I just need to follow the notes</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190162_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>He wrote down 50km (32miles) worth of road, although once I get into the city I will need to find the rest of the way on my own.  </p><p>Taking back my notebook, looking at alphabets that sort of look like English, </p><p>so there shouldn’t be any problem taking the notebook and go match it to the location signs, right?</p><p> </p><p>Now I feel much confident, before I left I asked if I could get some water. </p><p>Of course it is no problem again, and he give me a 2L worth of bottled water as well.  </p><p>I will be able to ride until I reach the next place that allows me to get more water.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190161_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Thank you for your good heart, so I can decide quickly, </p><p>and when I meet crossroads I meet later I will be able to pick which way to go.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190166_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I want to ride N4 road, if I can ride on it, then I can ride all the way to Paris, but the problem is I cannot ride on it.  </p><p>If I take small country road, then I need to go north first, then west, </p><p>make some turns, but I will ride extra 30km (18.7miles) more.</p><p> </p><p> Another recycling ad on the wall, the same style as the last one I saw.  </p><p>This time it says by recycling 5000 bottles, it can save a barrel of oil.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190168_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I already finished the toast I bought yesterday.  The Euro in my pocket is less than $1, after getting into this city; </p><p>I found a grocery store to get some goods. </p><p>I got some mixed juice, salty shrimp chips, some smiley cookies, and a loaf of bread.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190105_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So how did I pay for those since I don’t have any Euro on me?  </p><p>The answer is credit card.  But since I wasn’t sure if I can swipe my card, so I didn’t dare to get too many things, </p><p>and I got the bread I am already tired with.  </p><p>So if I couldn’t use my credit card, I can return rest of the items.  The cash on me is enough to purchase the loaf of bread.  </p><p>The total for all these items is $4.8 Euros, and when I got out my credit card, </p><p>the cashier didn’t’ give me any trouble just because the amount is too low. </p><p> </p><p>Finally I purchased new food; I opened up the juice and drink half of it.  I opened up the smiley cookie and ate lots of it.</p><p> </p><p> I will save the toast when I get really hungry.  One thing good about France is that as long as the road is seen on a map, </p><p>then it means the road is paved well, regardless how small it may be.  </p><p>Just like this road, the quality beats any road in Kazakhstan, but this is just a small road in France started with D.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190169_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I know I am riding extra due to the fact I can’t be on cars only path, but since the road condition is this excellent, </p><p>it does cut down the tiredness a bit.  Rather than complaining, I might as well get moving and bike faster. </p><p> </p><p> It feels like once I entered Europe, or should I say entering France, I felt the trip has ended.  </p><p>Just few hundreds of km left, but I still need to finish it, it will not finish on its own.  </p><p>It doesn’t matter how much I talk, the one that is riding is I.  Tossing away all emotions, just 1 thing left, going forward.</p><p> </p><p>After riding the 50km the guy told me earlier, I am now on N4 road again,</p><p>I am very thankful to the guy who wrote directions in my notebook.  </p><p>If it wasn’t for him, then I will just randomly going on my own, and I don’t know if I would be able to get back here.  </p><p>And even if I do get back here on my own, then it might be hours later. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190180_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Another thing that is to be happy about is the N4 road now allows bike to be on there, so now I can ride faster.  </p><p> </p><p>Cars only path and bike are almost the same; the only difference is there is no blue sign on the road. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190181_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The N4 road now has trucks passing by, but there is a shoulder area on the normally very crowded road.  </p><p>I try to ride closest to the edge, away from the big trucks.  </p><p>On roads with speed limit 110km/hour (69miles/hour) it is very scary to be next to the trucks, </p><p>this is because just with the wind blowing on me I am already swerving.</p><p> </p><p>Riding on N4, I am now reunited with road signs.  </p><p>When I saw the same sign this morning, it didn’t show how far I am from Paris.  </p><p>Right now about 3pm in the afternoon, I have 167km (104 miles) left. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190183_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So I am sure I will arrive at Paris tomorrow, that is, if I don’t get lost too much in Paris.  </p><p>I should be able to see the Eiffel tower before dark.  </p><p>But if I want to reach there by noon, then it isn’t just normal riding. </p><p>I would have to ride tonight in total darkness toward Paris. </p><p> </p><p>Looking at the sign, I feel Paris isn’t far away anymore.  </p><p>The map says on N4 only this section allows bike, so the rest I will need to find another way.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190187_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>That is ok, I will take whatever I can get.  If I can ride good for 1km is better than going in circles in the same place.  </p><p> </p><p>Rushing on N4 on this section toward Paris, but I actually got a flat tire, how can this be?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190192_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I got a flat tire on roads where huge trucks pass by, and this is the same tire I had just changed to a new inner tube yesterday. </p><p>When I left Poland at Goose’s, I had brought 3 brand new inner tubes.  </p><p>I had felt it will be fine, but just little distance here I have already broke 2 inner tubes already.  </p><p>Trying to park the bike away from the road, I am sitting in the grass, </p><p>the wind is blowing from passing by trucks, and I quickly put on new inner tubes.</p><p> </p><p> This time I didn’t need to find what caused the flat tire, </p><p>anyone other than being blind would be able to see this huge wire poked through the tire.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190194_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I am a bit sad seeing this huge wire poking through a brand new tire; it is a good thing the frame didn’t get damaged from it.  </p><p>Spending 10 minutes fixing the tire, I am not sure how much more I can ride before sun down. </p><p> </p><p>The sun is setting directly west to me, where my destination is.  </p><p>I will arrive tomorrow.  This trip started from Beijing will just need one more day to finish.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190198_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Tomorrow, Paris.</p><p> </p><p>I have not planned to sleep tonight.  I had planned to find a corner to rest a bit, and then ride during the early morning.  </p><p> </p><p>However much I can ride before sunrise, there is possibility I can arrive at Paris before noon.  </p><p>Following N4 road I found lots of rest stops, </p><p>I think this is because the trucks aren’t allowed on freeway, so all the freeway are on N4 now.  </p><p> </p><p>And at those rest stops, they have the basic 24-hour business; the area is huge, which allows lots of trucks parked here.  </p><p>When I discovered this place I had planned to go inside to eat, get some rest, </p><p>get my camera charged up, and then I will be able to ride. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190200_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>But then the door didn’t post a sign saying credit cards allowed, so I can’t spend money inside. </p><p> </p><p>Usually before the sun goes down, there will still be 1 hour of light out door.  </p><p>But as soon as the sun is at ground level, it will become completely dark in 15 minutes.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190203_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I turned on my back bicycle flashing light and the front bicycle light; following the shoulder I slowly continues to ride. </p><p>It is the same road condition, but it is very different between daylight and nighttime, at nighttime it feels much more dangerous. </p><p>The cars behind will use their high beam to shine on me first to see what is that flashing red light ahead.  </p><p>When the cars discover it is a bicycle, they will go around me. </p><p> </p><p>I am not afraid to be hit, but rather falling while riding in the dark.  </p><p>It is not clear the road condition ahead since it is pitch dark; </p><p>I only have 1-second time to figure out what I need to do before reaching it.  </p><p> </p><p>Around 10pm I got to this 24-hour gas station with no one there, I feel I am like an insect, attracted by lights. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190207_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Because there is no one at the gas station, so there is no worker here, this will be my rest stop today.  </p><p> </p><p>Good thing I found electricity plug here, so I plugged in to use it.  </p><p>Placing my behind against the sleeping bag, my back against the gas station machine, </p><p>I plan to use few hours to write the travel journals for the last 3 days.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190209_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Sitting at the gas station with the wind blowing against me,</p><p>I didn’t change anything, just took off my gloves and changed to the slipper.  </p><p> </p><p>The surrounding is pitch black; anywhere outside the gas station is completely dark.  </p><p>However, this is the gas station, even if there is no employee, there will be customers.  </p><p>Where I sit at is where people park there to get gas, so there are trucks passing by to get gas.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190211_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This guy is a truck driver; he just got here from Moscow and going to Paris.  </p><p>I point to the bike saying I am from Moscow too, and going to Paris. </p><p> </p><p>Once I said this he is a bit in shock.  But riding from Moscow to here is just part of the trip, just 1/3 of it.  </p><p>The guy chats with me while getting gas.  </p><p>He speaks French, I pretend I understand him, but my eyes and hands never left the computer. </p><p> </p><p>The guy didn’t leave after getting gas.  There are lots of truckers driving in here, park, </p><p>and sleep inside the gas station, I see he looked tired as well. </p><p>I am not sure how many days he is required to drive from Moscow to Paris. </p><p> </p><p>He sit in the tuck looking at me typing away on the computer, he felt interested. </p><p>Yes, it is my sleeping bag; the night is getting colder so I took out the sleeping bag to wrap myself up.</p><p> </p><p>Then I hear sound from the truck, and smelled coffee.  </p><p>The smell of coffee flew out, it is very unimaginable, and there is coffee maker inside the truck!  </p><p>So when he wants to drink coffee to get energy he can do so any time.  </p><p>He made 2 cups of coffee, one for himself and one for me. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190214_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>In the cold blowing wind I can hold on to a cup of hot coffee I feel great,</p><p>looking at the guy getting gas I had wanted to ask him if he can spare some for me, </p><p>this way I would have fuel for the hot plate.  But thinking I will get to Paris tomorrow, </p><p>what is the point getting fuel now? </p><p> </p><p>If the guy really do give me fuel, </p><p>then I will start the fire right here at the gas station, and tomorrow I would probably get on the news paper. </p><p> </p><p>Drinking the hot coffee from the guy, and I can get refills too.  </p><p>Saying good-bye to the guy and continue to type on the laptop. </p><p><img

was writing the travel journal for today, it is rare I write what is going on currently. </p><p> </p><p>In the cold night the temperature is 7C (44.6F), but the sleeping bag keeping me warm. </p><p>In the gas station I wrote 3 days worth of travel journals, it is a bit tiring.  </p><p>I wrote from 10pm all the way to 4am, total 6 hours, during which time I did not sleep at all.  </p><p>Using the coffee earlier to warm myself up and some boost of energy. </p><p> </p><p>After writing the journal, I pack up the sleeping bag and ready to leave.  </p><p>From 4am to 12pm, I have 8 hours to ride. </p><p>I don’t know if I can reach Paris before noon.  </p><p>Maybe by the time you are reading this travel journal, I already passed out under the Eiffel Tower, or crying my heart out.  </p><p>The more likely possibility is getting lost on the road.  </p><p>Regardless, whichever day, or how late it is, one day I will reach my destination.  </p><p> </p><p>Let’s go, it is time to end this trip.  </p><p><br /></p>
