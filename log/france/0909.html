sleeping bag or the mattress pad the night before.  </span></p><p>I just wrapped myself up in the sleeping bag and slept on the bench in front of the store for the night.  </p><p>The next morning the guy delivering the paper woke me up.  I didn’t realize I would sleep well like this too.  </p><p>It started raining lightly when I was getting ready to leave in the morning.  </p><p>This wasn’t a big problem since the rain wasn’t big, besides I have been rained on a lot lately so this little rain doesn’t bother me.  </p><p> </p><p>However, the bike was weird, it felt like it doesn’t want to move.  I bent down to check it and found out the back tire was out of air.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180892_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I knew the back tire has problems loosing air, but I thought it was just low pressure.  </p><p> </p><p>But after I wake up now the whole tire has no air, it looks like someone has let out the air completely.  </p><p>Is it possible something poked it?  I was suspicious, but the probability isn’t high so I still took off the tire and check.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180895_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had thought after I changed to the new tire, </p><p>the tire wouldn’t burst again on the way to Paris so I had not planned to open up my tools, but it is not avoidable.  </p><p>After my inspection, I didn’t find any holes, and the outer tire doesn’t seem to have any damage either.  </p><p>So I pumped the inner tube to see if I can find where the hole is, but I still cannot find any.  </p><p>So I pumped the tire back up and put it back on the bike. </p><p>I felt like I had wasted all this time but how come a perfectly good tire will not have any air?  </p><p> </p><p>While I was inspecting the tire, I took out the multi-purpose tool.  It looks like this after I have separated the whole thing.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180898_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This trip gives me a big lesson, rather than taking lots of tools that I might be using,</p><p>I should have taken a good tool that I would use. </p><p> </p><p>I shouldn’t take a multi-purpose tool that may not have much use to me, </p><p>because when I actually use it, it is hard to use and I would get angry.  </p><p>After putting the tire back I tried to move the bike, but the bike still wouldn’t move.  This time the chain got caught. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180900_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is a brand new chain; the chain got locked just after a tire change.  </p><p>I put on my working gloves and tried to get it back to normal.  </p><p>I had thought if the chain is back to normal everything will be ok, but this is just the start.  </p><p>Because the chain is caught, so a small section is now bent, </p><p>so when I ride the bike speed will change automatically every time the chain goes around one time regardless which speed I set the bike to. </p><p> </p><p>It is hard to describe how it feels, but my conclusion is “how can I ride like this?”  </p><p>So I got off the bike tried to fix the chain with some force, but the chain is too hard, and I don’t have enough strength.  </p><p>So without any tools I couldn’t bend the chain back.  The only thing I could do was to ride slowly toward Germany/France border.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180901_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It just had rained lightly in the morning so the sky is dark; it has the feel that we don’t know when it will rain again.  </p><p>Right now I am about 20km (12.4 miles) from the border.  </p><p>The Germany/France border here is separated by a river.  </p><p>The other side of the river is France, and of course where I am is Germany.  </p><p>Looking at the map I noticed I needed to ride a lot more before getting to a big city, there will be a bridge I can go to cross the river.  </p><p>The map does show lots of accessible roads next to the river, but none of them show a way to get across.  </p><p>However, I wouldn’t know the actual situation without going there in person, </p><p>so I rode close to the river and I saw boats that can go across.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180905_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If I can easily cross the river on the boat then I do not have to ride extra, </p><p>and no need to go into a city or cross a bridge.  </p><p>Next to the pier there is a post stating the price, </p><p>but I have no idea what it says not because it is in German but because it is written so complicated</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180909_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Right then there is also a grandpa taking his grandson on the boat so </p><p>I asked him how much it would be for the bike and myself the answer was $1.5 Euro ($2.25USD).  </p><p>Good thing I have enough money on me, and today is Sunday so all the stores are closed.  </p><p>Other than the fee to cross the river today, there is no other place I can spend money.  </p><p> </p><p>This is the only pier in 5km radius (3.1 miles) with the only boat.  </p><p>Even though the posting stated pricing but there is no stated time when the boat will leave.  </p><p>So I had the grandpa asking the crew that is cleaning the boat when will the boat leave?  </p><p>The crew doesn’t have an exact answer either since the captain went to get some coffee.  </p><p>Whenever the captain returns is when they will leave, and they do not know when the captain will return</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180911_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So I bought the ticket and waited on the boat, since it would save me at least an hour by taking the boat than crossing the bridge.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180915_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I got this little receipt after paying $1.5 Euro, however no information on it is correct, </p><p>they even have the date printed as September 17, 2008, and the price being 4.5 Euro.  </p><p> </p><p>There is a website for this boat too, for people who are interested they can take a look at what it says, </p><p>if there is pricing place study careful then you will know how complicated it is. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180916_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There are lots of people taking their bike across; there are 3 of them on the boat, but no car.  Business like this is a bit lonely.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180917_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Talking of business, after paying I just realized the past few times it is free taking the boat, </p><p>but this time it cost money. </p><p> </p><p>I guess if they don’t charge money, then there is no way to make a living.  </p><p>However, I didn’t waste any time, I took out my dirty and oily working gloves and tries to bend back the chain. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180922_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It is easy to see on the photo the middle of the chain is completely bent, regardless how hard I try it won’t bend back.  </p><p>So the only way is like this morning, letting it get tangled again except opposite direction, and then with some hard pull, </p><p>the chain is partly back to normal.  </p><p>I didn’t dare to use a lot of pressure just in case I may break the chain, then I wouldn’t be able to ride the rest of the way.  </p><p> </p><p>In the middle of fixing my bike, the captain returned from his coffee.  </p><p>The boat left shore very smoothly, and I didn’t even feel anything.  By the time I felt it, the boat had already left the shore.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180924_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Quickly I removed my dirty gloves and took some pictures with the camera.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180927_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It took about 2 minutes to get to the other side, a little money I will just pretend it is for captain’s coffee.  </p><p>On the other side of the river is France.  Right, it is this easy, already entered France. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180930_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There is no customs or immigration officer here to check luggage or passport, easily I went from Germany to France,</p><p>and there is no feel of getting into another country.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180931_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Thanks to the grandpa looking at the price for me.  </p><p>On Germany’s side I said thank you to him in German, and then in France I said thank you again in French.  </p><p> </p><p>This is another little bicycle sign, but smaller and different, there is a little “F” in the end of the location name.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180932_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Everyone, this is France.  Suddenly a totally different picture, everywhere it is farm fields.  </p><p> </p><p>So when I was eating the apple I picked from the road a white horse and a black goat came up to me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180937_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is like a test, which animal would you give the apple to?  </p><p> </p><p>The first impression when entering France is there are lots of bicycle riders!</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180939_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Is this the France I know?  Two years ago when I biked around France, </p><p>there are lots of roads do not allow bicycles on there that drove me nuts.  </p><p>Is it possible after 2 years France now follow Germany and constructed lots of bicycle path?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180943_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Riding there is very nice, nice scenery, cool weather, flat road, and no cars competing with me. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180944_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Following the bike path toward the city, there are lots of people riding bicycles.  </p><p>Whenever there is a table or grassy area, I would see bikers picnic on the side. </p><p>In my heart I was hoping some family that is picnicking would ask me to join them.  </p><p>Wishing is wishing; something like this didn’t happen so I ate my toast for both breakfast and lunch.  </p><p> </p><p>There is a little problem after entering the city.  </p><p>I had thought the map Peter gave me was a map of Europe, </p><p>but then I realized it was just a map of Germany with some bordering roads in France.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180949_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>It would be impossible riding to Paris just with this map; since the road to Paris is very complicated.  </p><p>For just 4 days trip I don’t want to purchase a new map, </p><p>so I used city maps posted trying to figure out which ways I should take.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180950_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>here first, see if I can connect to a big road and go toward west.  </p><p>Germany’s borders are rivers not mountains, so there is no need to climb mountains. </p><p>However, once entering France there are lots of uneven mountains, even if they are not steep, it will still be difficult. </p><p>  </p><p>However, the good news is that once entering France it will be good weather. </p><p>I have been under lots of cloudy sky for days, so let’s have bright blue sky for a while.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180952_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though just a small map here, but this is better than nothing.  I better study how I can get out of.</p><p> </p><p>Even though those roads aren’t steep, but it is very tiring.  </p><p>There are lots of people riding bikes here, and there are even people riding in uniforms in a group</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180959_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Climbing so tiring, how high is it exactly?  I am embarrassed to say, it is just 400meters above sea level.  </p><p>Is it possible because I have only been eating toast lately so I am tired, not like before when I ate good meals?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180963_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>On the top of this hill, there are 2 cars parked.  </p><p>One of the guys is standing next to the road, and when I passed by they waved for me to stop.  </p><p>They spoke with fluent German, and they even drove past me earlier.  </p><p>Seeing me riding the bike with lots of luggage, and the one that attracted their attention are the 2 spare tires.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180964_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>What they are holding is my meter counter, the total right now is 13688km (8500 miles), looking at this number, </p><p>the people from the car screamed “you crazy”.  It turned out to be 2 families; the one holding the camera is a little girl.  </p><p>European families are interesting; doesn’t the dad usually hold the camera in occasions like this?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180965_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The German dad told the little girl in the car to take a picture for everyone and then handed her the camera, </p><p>the little girl just followed what her dad said.  </p><p> </p><p>After taking the picture they asked me where I am headed?  </p><p>We ended up having the same destination; they are going to Paris as well.  </p><p>So I took the chance asking if the dad has a map of France, can I see it? </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180966_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The dad has lots of maps in the car; the storage place on the door is packed.  </p><p>He fumbled around a bit and asked me which one is better.  </p><p>Then he took one that says “1cm=10km” whole map of France.  </p><p> </p><p>If I want to ride farther than Paris I can still continue.  </p><p>Taking this time I opened up the map and took a picture.  </p><p>First I found where I am at first, and then figured out what road I can take to get to Paris.  </p><p>Taking a picture and took some notes down</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180969_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Writing just few words, the dad said I could have this one, no need to write so much.  </p><p>He also wished me have a safe trip to Paris, and they will reach Paris tonight. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180993_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>So in this way I got a map of France, it is like playing a RPG game. </p><p>I got stopped by stranger, chat a bit, and then got a map as a gift.  </p><p>So the confusing roads now became clear, riding without a map is like missing something.  I feel better now with a map.</p><p> </p><p>From the map there seems to be 2 roads to Paris, N3 and N4. </p><p>In France, the highways all start with “A”, the rest of the roads start with “N”, “D”, “C”, and “L”. </p><p>In theory, other than “A”, the rest allow bicycles.  </p><p>However in reality, a lot of roads are for cars only, </p><p>and the map do not show which roads are for cars only unless you go there yourself.  </p><p>So now I need to figure out what roads to take, the path I had planned are being changed now.  </p><p>So trying to figure out a path to take, it is like what happened 2 years ago when I traveled around France.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180971_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though the mountain isn’t so high, but the view is very open. </p><p>Looking at the farm fields, there are lots of corns in the field.  </p><p> </p><p>Some small town in the mountains, there is a mini gas station here.  </p><p>Seeing the gas station is this small, then I know there isn’t lots of business here. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180978_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Most of the buildings here are family housing, definitely a church, plus some bars, bakery, and then a post office.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180983_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After paying the ferry, the cash on me is now even less.  </p><p>I wanted to exchange some USD on me for some Euros, just in case when I need money I have nothing on me.  </p><p>But when this thought occurred to me, I realized today is Sunday, the day all the stores are close.  </p><p> </p><p>So I have to last one more day, then I will see if there is any bank open tomorrow for me to exchange some money.  </p><p>Mom, I have been eating, don’t worry, even if just eating bread, but I still fill myself, and not being hungry.  </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180985_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The tiny faucet, if I just press on it, lots of water will flow out.  </p><p>This is probably spring water.  Taking this chance to wash my headband, and drink a stomach full of water, </p><p>filling the water bottle then continue on my way.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180989_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>My stomach filled with toast and spring water and I feel filled, so I just tell myself I have ate a big meal. </p><p>Then I will eat a big meal once I get to Paris to thank myself. </p><p> </p><p>Another town in the mountain.  Even though I have a map in my hand, but those towns are not seen on the map.  </p><p>So the scale on the map isn’t so great.  So when I use this map to ride I need to be prepared I might get lost.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180992_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>When I get hungry I have some candies I can eat, and a packet of walnuts from yesterday.  </p><p>The walnut shell is extremely hard; it is impossible to crack it by my hands.  </p><p>So I put it on the ground and step on it. </p><p> </p><p>I have to be careful with the pressure I use,</p><p>just in case if I smash the whole thing then I will have to eat walnut mixed with gravel and dust.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180995_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The walnut tastes pretty good, it has a bitter taste when first eating it.  </p><p>But after some chewing there is a strong flavor.  </p><p>Even though this cannot fill stomach, but it is a change of flavor.  </p><p>Keep eating candy; I felt my mouth is about to become numb.  </p><p> </p><p>The very very tiny town in the mountains, but there is a ridiculous large castle here; it is so grand I can’t keep my mouth closed.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1180999_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>If I didn’t have my map, then usually in a place like this I would try to find the tourist center.  </p><p>But since I have my map, I won’t go bother them.</p><p> </p><p>When I rode the bike today, the back tire is also loosing air all the way to the point where it looks like it is nearly out of air. </p><p>In one day, I have pumped air into the tire 3 times in order to ride the rest of the way.  </p><p>So I guess there must be some hole in the back tire, but the hole is so small so I have not found it yet.  </p><p>But it is very tiring riding and pumping the tire all the time.  In addition, riding a bike without air in it feels very heavy. </p><p>I considered changing the inner tube for the rear tire, but since I can still ride for few hours every time I pump the rear tire, </p><p>then I better not waste my time.  </p><p>Time would be better spent in riding the bike. </p><p> </p><p>Guess why I would be on the grass?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190005_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is because the road next to me is “D” road, it became for cars only.  </p><p>So now I need to find bike path again.  What I had done in Germany isn’t practical here.  </p><p>This is because the bike path here isn’t planned well, so sometimes I would have nowhere to ride.  </p><p>But I have no choices right now so I ended up riding on cars only road again, </p><p>and trying to find another place to turn as soon as there is an intersection coming up down the road.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190007_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Even though I did get out of the cars only road, </p><p>but after studying the map a bit I couldn’t find what path I can take instead of this one.  </p><p> </p><p>So under the circumstance, I ended up on the cars only road again.  </p><p>The little blue sign with car on it is getting annoying; they sometimes even have a sign that says no bike allowed.  </p><p>Then there are double signs against me riding on the cars only road.  </p><p> </p><p>Riding about 10km on the cars only road I had thought I might get stopped by cops.  </p><p>But luckily, I didn’t and I was able to ride to the next time.  </p><p>Then I need to take N62, but this is cars only road again, then where should I ride?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190008_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>This is the path I had planned to take when I got the map, but now it is useless.  </p><p>So I am flipping through the map trying to figure out which path to take to get to Paris, </p><p>but rather, I am trying to figure out how to ride out of this town.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190011_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After seeing this street sign, I feel it is somewhat familiar, “Saarbrucken”.  </p><p>The name of this town, sounds like the place where Peter’s friend lives.  </p><p>Even though this particular path allows bike, but I better not go bother someone else, besides I don’t know the exact address.  </p><p>So I will just figure out how to survive for the next few days.  </p><p> </p><p>Since I can’t get out of this town before sun down, but I better enter this town.  </p><p>The first time I need to do is to find a detailed map of this town that will be the local tourist center.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190013_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I did find it, but it is already closed.  They are so cruel, there is a traveler needing your help right now.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190015_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Good thing right outside there is a map of this town posted.  </p><p>After studying a bit I took a picture of it on the safe side.  </p><p>So now I have found a way to get out of this town, I just hope I can follow it to let me ride out of town.  </p><p> </p><p>The sky is starting to get dark, and since I am planning to get to Paris in 3 days, </p><p>I have to ride about 150km(93.15miles) each day.  </p><p>Of course the more I can ride the better, if I didn’t ride that much each day, then it will get harder later. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190020_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The people crossing by during sunset.  Looking in through the window of a popular restaurant, I noticed it is time for dinner. </p><p>If this is a resting travel, then I would stay in this town, find a hotel to stay in, </p><p>take a hot shower, and then pick a nice restaurant to have my dinner.  </p><p> </p><p>However, none of this would happen, so the best thing is continuing riding toward my destination. </p><p>If I ride harder now, then I can have a good rest later. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190023_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Thanks to the local map from the local tourist center so now I found D910 road.  </p><p>This is not a cars only road, but bikes allowed as well.  </p><p>The sky will turn dark in 30 minutes, so I better ride as much as I can now. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190024_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had thought about riding in the dark with my bike lights on.  </p><p>Even though the night is cold, but there should be a way to ride right?  </p><p> </p><p>Church, the door is locked as well. </p><p>Right now my water bottle is empty so I circled the church once trying to find a water faucet, but no luck.  </p><p>After entering France, 2 things are getting hard to find, water faucet and electric outlets.  </p><p>Those two things happen to be what I need the most.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190029_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Riding in the night seems easy, but it will be very difficult.  </p><p>This is because in the countryside there are no lights to guide me except the cars that are passing by, so it will be completely dark.  </p><p> </p><p>The tiny headlight on the bike is not bright enough to ensure safety.  </p><p>So just riding a little in the night I already remembered what </p><p>happened 2 years ago when I was in France where I fell of the bike during the night.  </p><p> </p><p>During that night, with my bloody hands I sat in a dark bus stop.  </p><p>Because I had fell off the bike, I had to fix the bike tire that burst from my fall.  </p><p>Then I had to endure the pain and continue to ride and slept in the bitter cold abandoned gas station.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190031_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Right after all that thought, the sky turned dark.  </p><p>The passing cars wouldn’t slow down just because it is nighttime.  </p><p>Even thought the bike has a red flashing light on, but it isn’t bright enough, the driver won’t see it unless they get close to me.  </p><p>The result of trying to avoid those cars will scare both the driver and myself, followed by honking at me from the drivers.  </p><p>So the thought of riding more during the night is not a good idea, so I better find a place to rest. </p><p>Rest well tonight then I can leave early tomorrow.  </p><p>I am not planning to writing travel journal during the day time, so I have lots of time to ride the bike,</p><p>I would be surprised if I can’t ride at least 150km each day.</p><p> </p><p>After giving up riding in the nighttime I start searching for a place to sleep, the locked church door, the closed city hall, </p><p>I didn’t find a place I liked after looking at a few places.  </p><p>I wouldn’t be able to sleep in a bus stop either, this is because in France they use clear plastic paneling for the bus stop, </p><p>so there is no way to hide in there.  </p><p>The bench is also short and small; it looks like it will be very hard to sleep on it. </p><p>I am very thirsty right now. </p><p>I finally found a faucet outside a house so I went to see if there is water, but 9 out of 10 the faucet is dry.</p><p> </p><p>I finally found this water source.  The night is cold enough already, </p><p>and water is cold enough to be frozen.  So even if I filled my water bottle I did not dare to drink lots of it.  </p><p>I am afraid if I drink too much cold water my stomach will not be able to take it.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190032_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Looking at this water source, other than it gives me water; it also let me have a rest place.  </p><p>I will spend the night in the mini park behind it.  </p><p>It is this tiny log cabin, now you can see how small it is next to the bike. </p><p>This log cabin is for kids; tonight I plan to sleep inside.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1190033_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>After some estimation, there is no need to get out the mattress pad or the tent since there is no place to put it.  </p><p>I will just wrap myself inside the sleeping bag, and lean against the wood board.</p><p>It is very difficult to sleep, during the night my behind and my back were hurting, </p><p>and my feet were numb due to low blood circulation, so I kept changing my sleeping positions.  </p><p>The night got colder and colder to the point I couldn’t believe it is September.  </p><p>I didn’t want to scare myself so I didn’t go look on the thermometer.  </p><p>I just took a thick clothing and wrap up my head. </p><p>After separating from the cold air it got easier to sleep.  </p><p>It was an ok place to sleep other than the fact I had to change positions every 20 minutes. </p><p> </p><p>The reason I picked here is because the watch showed it will rain, so I tried to pick a place that does have a roof covering.  </p><p>When I was little, I find playing in log cabins like this is interesting.  </p><p>However, when I got older it wasn’t so fun sleeping in here, it is cold, cold, and cold to the bones</p><p><br
