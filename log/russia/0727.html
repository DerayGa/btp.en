I sat up in the tent, looked outside, and saw a peeing shadow.</p><p>He was even more startled than I was when he saw someone in the empty house. </p><p>It was not fun to frighten each other like that. I wanted to get more sleep if possible.</p><p> </p><p>There were several advantages of camping, such as no need to keep my eyes open to write up travel logs, </p><p>to take a shower, and to do my laundry. </p><p>Also, some money could be saved. That made me feel I had achieved something.</p><p>When my alarm went off, the passing cars made the sound of water swooshing. </p><p>It had rained again last night. Luckily, it had stopped at dawn.</p><p>However, a rain cloud was still lingering in the sky. </p><p>It should have been sunrise around 8:00am, however it just looked like it was before daybreak.</p><p>The temperature always remained around 20 degrees C before noon, and then it worked its way up. </p><p>I felt chilly but cherished the coolness – super comfy for cycling.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110337_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The benefit of turning to M7 instead of staying on M5 showed when I saw a road sign again </p><p>showing that Moscow was only 1,300 km away. </p><p>This option cut short the route by 300 km in a flash.</p><p>A huge gain, although more sections of M7 were winding through mountains. </p><p>Hopefully I would still think M7 was the right choice in the end. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110338_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>A variety of crops were grown in Russia such as little white flowers which were also grown in the back yards of farmers’ houses. </p><p>But I had no idea what they were.</p><p>Riding through the ocean of white flowers in the chilly morning, was I heading to the netherworld?</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110340_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I had been expecting a restaurant since I left the empty house. </p><p>As long as I saved money on accommodation, I would reward myself with better food the next day.</p><p>Around 10:00am I found a big restaurant, it also had a newsstand.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110349_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>There was a sink right in front of the newsstand. </p><p>I did not take a shower yesterday but roughly wiped my face clean with a not-quite damp towel,</p><p>so I was very happy to see a faucet.</p><p>If nobody was around, I would take a shower just here. Too bad, a lady was sitting right in front of me.</p><p>I still felt great to thoroughly wash my face, damping the towel, going outside, and sort of wiping my body. </p><p>Was it more of a psychological problem or I was really dirty? I felt itching all over my body.</p><p> </p><p>Why did I say this restaurant was big? It had quite a lot of tables and chairs, </p><p>food was served in cafeteria-style and you could see what goodies were available.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110353_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110354_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Finally I could order at ease without looking at the menu in Russian and making gestures. </p><p>A cup of hot black tea to start with, it came with a box of matches.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110355-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>I just mentioned the advantages of camping, </p><p>but I still had to find time to write my travel log the next day and bear the consequence of not taking a shower and not doing the laundry.</p><p>I sat down at a table spotting Dido parked outside and changed my mood. </p><p>Having some tea to pretend to be elegant, I converted myself into a writer.</p><p> </p><p>After finishing up the log I went to order a main meal when it was about noon – a brunch then.</p><p>I got a large roasted chicken leg with bread, vegetables, </p><p>fruits and chicken noodle soup with many ingredients and meat, and two more boxes of matches came with the meal. </p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110360-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>That reminded me that quite a few people asked me for cigarettes along the road, especially workers, farmers and hitchhikers.</p><p>Of course, I shook my head saying no cigarettes. </p><p>I was thinking of buying a pack to give away a couple of times. I do not smoke, why waste money on cigarettes? </p><p> </p><p>Finishing up the travel log and meal, leaving the restaurant around 1:00pm, I was a bit frightened when I saw the time. </p><p>The cool cycling time in the morning had long gone.</p><p>The temperature outside had been up to 30 degrees C. </p><p>The cloud was not as dense as it was in the morning; the sun had also come out. </p><p>I regretted that I had the dry-fit thermal on, and was sweating like a pig.</p><p> </p><p>About one hour after leaving the restaurant, I felt an unusual sway and the rear wheel shifted. </p><p>Even it was a very mild, it was there.</p><p>I thought it would be ok. However, </p><p>after a couple of times when a truck passed by the bike wobbled terribly and I almost fell off Dido, </p><p>I went to a bus stop to check out Dido for safety.</p><p>The small bus stop was full of weeds with a roof blocking the sun for me.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110372_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>The tires were checked to be inflated before I set off in the morning. </p><p>However, I could easily squeeze the rear tire now. Three minutes after pumping up I got a flat tire again.</p><p>Obviously, there was a hole in the tire from which air was leaking slowly – I had a flat tire.</p><p>It had been quite loooooong since last flat tire happened, about 62 days ago. </p><p>Two months without a flat tire, I almost forgot there was such a thing.</p><p>The flat tire was caused by small piece of gravel which was not sharp at all.</p><p>The reason that the gravel could get in the outer tire was because there was an old hole punctured by barbed wire.</p><p>What a coincidence, the chance was one out of ten million for gravel getting into the same old hole to give me a flat.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110374_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Checking out the outer tires, I saw many small holes and some shallow cracks. </p><p>The tires did not seem wearing out terribly.</p><p>These outer tires had lasted more than 9,000 km, so they had outperformed their average life time. </p><p>Even though there were six bright new outer tires in my bag, I did not plan to change them till I got to Moscow.</p><p> </p><p>Many wheat fields along the road, some were still green and young,</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110368_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>while some had turned golden and were ready for harvest.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110391-2_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p>Some strange plants were visible mixed in the wheat fields, such as sunflowers.</p><p>Some had been harvested and only loose wheat straw was left in the harvested field. </p><p>I was curious what the straw could be used for.</p><p> </p><p>Cap picking up frequency: at least 10 times a day. </p><p>When strong wind gusted, or trucks swooshed by, my cap could be blown away.</p><p>When turning around to pick up the cap, I had to look out for the vehicles coming behind me. </p><p>Sometime it was blown across the road which made the pickup like an adventure. I risked my life in getting it back.</p><p><img src="../../_Media/p1110377_med_hr-3.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="506" class="not-first-item" /></p><p> </p><p>Small-scale oil fields are scattering in this area. </p><p>Small oil pumps are easy to see in farm fields or on roadsides.</p><p>Here there is no factory or oil pipe yet, my guess is the oil pumps must be invested by farmers, </p><p>setting up a few in the fields. If they can get the oil to flow, they probably can quit farming.</p><p>At 6:00pm I took a break at a gas station, bought some juice for tomorrow, and planed not to stay in a hotel tonight. </p><p>The juice would be cold tomorrow morning.</p><p>The Russians I met were all very friendly which was very different than the cold faces that I expected. </p><p>They would initiate a conversation and chat with me, which felt good.</p><p>There were quite a few small towns along the road where I was always expecting to see shops or restaurants.</p><p>The possibility of finding shops in a town was low if it was away from the main road.</p><p>The possibility is higher if the town was along the main road. Riding through the town, I saw nothing, just a pure residential area.</p><p>Continuing riding for a while, I saw a gas station and a restaurant in the middle of nowhere – strange business model. </p><p>The first thing to do in the restaurant was not food or drink. </p><p>There was a water bucket outside of the restaurant with cold water flowing out of the faucet. </p><p>I saw the remedy to cure my itching body – a shower.</p><p>The water bucket was next to the restaurant where many trucks parked and customers were coming in and going out. </p><p>I REALY FELT LIKE A SHOWER. </p><p>Getting rid of my shyness, removing my bandanas, taking off my shirt and pants, </p><p>I was in my boxers taking a sponge bath with a towel, in bright daylight. </p><p>I felt awkward at first, when the cold towel that was used to wipe off my body sweat and dirt touched me, </p><p>an embarrassment became nothing. It was so comfortable to take a shower. </p><p>By the way, I was caught by surprise when squatting down washing my head. </p><p>A few days ago, with the rain was going on, I took shelter in a hotel room. I felt dizzy in daytime and thought I had a cold.</p><p>When I touched the dry blood on my scalp, I realized that I hit my head while staying in the hotel. </p><p>I thought it was ok back then, but it did not seem fine when I saw the blood.</p><p>My dizziness was very likely caused by a mild concussion. </p><p>I woke up next morning feeling much better. I thought my resistance against a cold was greater, </p><p>but now I should correct it as “my resistance against a head injury”</p><p>I was a clean man again. </p><p>The worries were purely from my imagination because nobody was surprised or disgusted by me taking a shower here.</p><p>Getting into the restaurant feeling fresh, </p><p>I ordered exactly what was on the empty plates and bowls while looking at the dirty dishes on the table.</p><p>What was on the empty plates and bowls were roasted chicken drumstick, </p><p>meat sauce pasta, potato carrot and corn soup, bread and milk tea. I was stuffed with the “exact order”.</p><p>This restaurant was open 24 hours. I was thinking of staying here overnight, but it seemed too troublesome. </p><p>In addition, what was I going to do with Dido?</p><p>I finished the travel log at the restaurant for its power. </p><p>How about sleeping on the outdoor bench outside of the restaurant?</p><p>It did not seem to be a good campsite because it was in an open area – easy to be seen. </p><p>If it rained, I would definitely get wet.</p><p>The lady owner did not recommend me to sleep there for safety because this restaurant sold alcohol, </p><p>many people would come for a drink. She was afraid that drunks might cause trouble.</p><p> </p><p>All in all, camping on the outdoor bench was not a good idea. Walking with Dido, </p><p>I looked for a place to spend the night and saw a bed-like iron structure within the fenced-off area of a power station.</p><p>The weeds were not too out of control to overwhelm me. What was inevitable was the large amount of insects - very scary.</p><p> </p><p>The iron structure seemed to be a good bed frame, even though it was not long enough for me and I had to bend my knees. </p><p>With my inflatable mat laid out on top of the iron structure, it should feel much better. With all that, I did not need to sleep on dirt.</p><p>With the fence blocking the view from outside, the safety issue was worked out.</p><p>The only problem was no roof and my watch forecasted rain. </p><p>If it started raining at night, it would be “fantastic” – so I was praying for tonight to be dry.</p><p><br /></p>
